IT'S UNDER THE BLOOD

Verse 1 (2-3 YP)
While walking down a memory lane of paths so long ago
Old Satan came right by my side making me feel low

He brought up thoughts of hurt and pain when I had gone astray
He wanted to discourage me as I walked along my way

Verse 2 (2-3 YP)
He said you're undeserving 'cause I know where you've been
I have a record of your life when you were bound by sin

I know your darkest secrets that you would never tell
What makes you think you don't deserve a place with me in Hell?

Verse 3 (2-3 YP)
Well, I heard the old accuser and this was my reply
You're right for all the things I've done I truly deserve to die

My righteousness is filthy rags, my goodness is unclean
There's only one thing I can say to what you've said to me

Chorus (ALL)
It's under the blood, oh praise His dear name
I'm not what I used to be, my life's been changed

Not shackled by sin and shame, it's already gone
I'm happy reminding him, it's under the blood

Verse 4 (ALL)
Victory was given me when I was born again
He washed your stained and sinful past and put new life within

No longer do I bare the mark that sin had brought my way
With happiness and peace of mind, praise God, I now can say!

Chorus
It's under the blood, oh praise His dear name
I'm not what I used to be, my life's been changed

Not shackled by sin and shame, it's already gone
I'm happy reminding him, it's under the blood

What can wash away my sins?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

What can make me whole again?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

Chorus
It's under the blood, oh praise His dear name
I'm not what I used to be, my life's been changed

Not shackled by sin and shame, it's already gone

I'm happy reminding him, 

IT'S UNDER THE BLOOD
