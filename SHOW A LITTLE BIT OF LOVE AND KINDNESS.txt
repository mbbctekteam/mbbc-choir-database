SHOW A LITTLE BIT OF LOVE AND KINDNESS
Words and Music By: John W. Peterson

Verse 1
Sing a song (Sing a song)
Spread some cheer (Spread some cheer)

There are sad and lonely people everywhere
Be a friend (Be a friend)

Show some love (Show some love)
It will lift them from the dungeons of despair

Verse 2
Be a light (Be a light)
Show the way (Show the way)

Be a light within the night for those astray
Speak a word (Speak a word)

Loving word (Loving word)
That will bring them back to walk the narrow way

Chorus
Show a little bit of love and kindness
Never go around with hatred's blindness

Take a little time to reach for joy and wear a happy face
Sing a little bit when the days are dreary

Give a little help to a friend that's weary
That's the way to make the world a happy place

Chorus
Show a little bit of love and kindness
Never go around with hatred's blindness

Take a little time to reach for joy and wear a happy face
Sing a little bit when the days are dreary

Give a little help to a friend that's weary
That's the way to make the world a happy place

That's the way to make the world a happy place
That's the way to make the world

A HAPPY PLACE
