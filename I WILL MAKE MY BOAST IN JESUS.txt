I WILL MAKE MY BOAST IN JESUS
Words and Music by James Harris and Paul Keew

Verse 1
I will make my boast in Jesus,
The Lamb of Calvary.

By His death I now am ransomed;
Once a pris’ner, now set free.

I will make my boast in Jesus,
In robes of righteousness.

Sin committed, now forgiven;
I’m an heir with Christ by grace!

Chorus
I will boast in Christ my King!
Of His sov’reign grace I’ll sing!

Tell of love’s great sacrifice;
Live a life that points to Christ!

Live a life that points to Christ!

Verse 2
I will make my boast in Jesus,
Not in works that I have done.

By His grace and by His Spirit,
He is changing me through love.

I will make my boast in Jesus,
Who reigns as Heaven’s King.

When He calls me home to glory,
His eternal praise I’ll sing!

Chorus
I will boast in Christ my King!
Of His sov’reign grace I’ll sing!

Tell of love’s great sacrifice;

Live a life that points to Christ!
Live a life that points to Christ!

Chorus
I will boast in Christ my King!
Of His sov’reign grace I’ll sing!

Tell of love’s great sacrifice;
Live a life, live a life, live a life

THAT POINTS TO CHRIST!
