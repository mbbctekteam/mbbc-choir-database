Verse 1
Behold the cross where life eternal died,
God's Lamb, the Christ, our final sacrifice.

No other blood removes iniquity.
No other man redeems humanity.

Chorus
Embrace the cross,
And gloryin its shame,

With all your heart, live worthy of His name.
O follow Christ, regardless of the cost

Give everything to Jesus and His cross.

Verse 2
Take up your cross upon the Calvary road,
With steadfast faith, remain beneath the load.

Consider all the suffering Jesus knew.
Consider Him; His grace will carry you.

Verse 3
Proclaim the cross til every nation hears
That for our sin the Son of God was pierced.

In Jesus' name, go forth in Gospel might!
In Jesus' love, present Christ crucified!

Chorus
Embrace the cross,
And glory in its shame,

With all your heart, live worthy of His name.
O follow Christ, regardless of the cost

Give everything to Jesus and his cross

O follow Christ, regardless of the cost
Give everything to Jesus

EMBRACE THE CROSS
