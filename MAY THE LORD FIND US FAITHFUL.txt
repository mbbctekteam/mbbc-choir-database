MAY THE LORD FIND US FAITHFUL 
Words and Music by Mac Lynch

Verse 1
God has not given us the spirit of fear
But has given us the strength to obey

With power and sound mind, with love the unfailing kind
O be not ashamed of His way

Chorus
May the Lord find us faithful
May His Word be our banner held high

May the Lord find us faithful
Ev'ry day, though we live, though we die

Verse 2
No man that seeketh after things of this life
Is a soldier who passes the test

Be faithful, be working, be running, be serving
Be searching His word for His best

Chorus
May the Lord find us faithful
May His Word be our banner held high

May the Lord find us faithful
Ev'ry day, though we live, though we die

Verse 3
Living or dying may honor be Thine
From this wretched life, You loved and forgave

A life that is on fire, be only our hearts desire
Be faithful from now to the grave

Chorus
May the Lord find us faithful
May His Word be our banner held high

May the Lord find us faithful
Ev'ry day, though we live, though we die

Chorus
May the Lord find us faithful
May His Word be our banner held high

May the Lord find us faithful
Ev'ry day, though we live, though we die

Ev'ry day, though we live, though we die
