MAY THE LORD FIND US FAITHFUL
MBBC Choir

Words and Music By Mac Lynch
Arranged by Mac Lynch

God has not given us the spirit of fear
But has given us the strength to obey

With power and sound mind
With love the unfailing kind

O be not ashamed of His way

Verse 2
No man that seeketh
After things of this life

Is a soldier who passes the test
Be faithful be working

Be running be serving
Be searching His word for His best

Chorus
May the Lord find us faithful
May His Word be our banner held high

May the Lord find us faithful
Ev'ry day though we live though we die

Verse 3
Living or dying may honor be Thine
From this wretched life

You loved and forgave
A life that is on fire

Be only our hearts desire

Be faithful from now to the grave

Chorus
May the Lord find us faithful
May His Word be our banner held high

May the Lord find us faithful
Ev'ry day though we live though we die

May the Lord find us faithful

Ev'ry day though we live though we die
