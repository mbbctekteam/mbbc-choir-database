GOD SEES THE HEART
Words and Music By Jamie Turner and Ron Hamilton

Verse 1
Our God measures man by a standard divine
For He sees underneath ev'ry outward design

He looks past possessions and costly attire
He studies the heart, ev'ry thought and desire

Chorus
For the eyes of the Lord are searching to and fro
We have no secrets that our God does not know

Our Father knows our thoughts, He understands ev'ry part
Man sees the outside, but God sees the heart

Verse 2
Our God does not judge by how tall we may stand
Or how much we possess, or the rank we command

His gaze goes far deeper to things that endure
He honors the man who keeps his heart pure

Chorus
For the eyes of the Lord are searching to and fro
We have no secrets that our God does not know

Our Father knows our thoughts, He understands ev'ry part
Man sees the outside, but God sees the heart

Chorus
For the eyes of the Lord are searching to and fro
We have no secrets that our God does not know

Our Father knows our thoughts, He understands ev'ry part
Man sees the outside, but God sees the heart

Man sees the outside, but God sees the heart
