CHRIST IS SUFFICIENT

Nothing I’ve done could merit God’s grace;
Nothing I’ll do can take it away.

I have one hope, in life and death:
I have been clothed in Christ’s righteousness.

Nothing remains since Jesus has died;
Justice was paid; the Judge satisfied.

Great is my sin; greater His love;
I have been cleansed with Calvary’s blood!

Christ is sufficient! His work is finished! 
He is my faith’s Author and End; 
Christ is enough—my Savior and Friend!

Nothing I’ve sought on earth satisfies;
I was designed to thirst after Christ.

Beckoned by Him, “Drink and be filled.”
I am content, yet yearn for Him still.

Nothing but Christ can undo the Fall.
He will return to reign over all.

Come to us, Lord; right ev’ry wrong;
Soon the redeemed will join heaven’s song.

Christ is sufficient! His work is finished! 
He is my faith’s Author and End; 
Christ is enough—my Savior and Friend!

Christ is enough—my Savior and Friend!
