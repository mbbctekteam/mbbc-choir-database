"Wondrous Promise of the Father"
Words & Music by Mac Lynch

Wondrous promise of the Father,
Precious truth to which I cling,

Midst the dark clouds swiftly gath-ring,
And the fears each day would bring.

Chorus
He is there, and every will be,
Whence I come, whither I go, 

In the night as in the morning,
That is all I need to know.

All I need and nothing further,
For in HIm I'm truly blest,

He my Keeper and Provider,
He my Helper and my Rest.

Wondrous promise of the Father.
For whate'er the day may bring,

His is there and ever will be,
Precious truth to which I cling.
