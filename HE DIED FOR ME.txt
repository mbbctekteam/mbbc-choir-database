He Died For Me
MBBC Choir

verse 1
I saw One hanging on a tree, In agony and blood;

He fixed His languid eyes one me, As near His cross I stood.

Verse 2
Sure, never, till my latest breath, Can I forget that look;

It seemed to charge me with His death, Tho'not a word He spoke.

Chorus
Oh, can it be, upon a tree The Savior died for me?
My soul is thrilled, My heart is filled,

To think He died for me!

Verse 3
My conscience felt and owned the guilt, And plunged me in despair;

I saw my sins His blood has spilt And helped to nail Him there.

Verse 4
Alas! I knew not what I did, But now my tears are vain;

Where shall my tembling soul be hid? For I the Lord have slain.

Chorus
Oh, can it be, upon a tree The Savior died for me?
My soul is thrilled, My heart is filled,

To think He died for me!

Verse 5
A second look He gave, which said, "I freely all forgive:

This blood is for thy ransom paid. I die that thou may'st live."

Chorus
Oh, can it be, upon a tree The Savior died for me?
My soul is thrilled, My heart is filled,

To think He died for me!

end
To think He died for me!
