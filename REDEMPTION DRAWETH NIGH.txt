REDEMPTION DRAWETH NIGH
Adult Ladies

Verse 1
Years of time have come and gone
Since I first heard it told

How Jesus would come again some day
If back then it seemed so real

Then I just can't help but feel
How much closer His coming is today

Chorus
Signs of the times are everywhere
There's a brand new feeling in the air

Keep your eyes upon the eastern sky
Lift up your head, redemption draweth nigh

Verse 2
Wars and strife on every hand
And violence fills the land

Still some people doubt He'll ever come again
Oh, but the Word of God is true

He'll redeem His chosen few
So don't lose hope for soon Christ Jesus will descend

Chorus
Signs of the times are everywhere
There's a brand new feeling in the air

Keep your eyes upon the eastern sky
Lift up your head, redemption draweth nigh

Chorus
Signs of the times are everywhere
There's a brand new feeling in the air

Keep your eyes upon the eastern sky

Lift up your head, redemption draweth nigh
