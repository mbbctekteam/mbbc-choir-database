intro
Nailed to the cross
MBBC CHOIR

verse 1
There was One who was willing to die in my stead,
That a soul so unworthy might live,

And the path to the cross He was willing to tread,
All the sins of my life to forgive.

chorus
They are nailed to the cross,
They are nailed to the cross,

O how much He was willing to bear!
With what anguish and loss,

Jesus went to the cross!
But He carried my sins with Him there.

verse 2
He is tender and loving and patient with me,
While He cleanses my heart of its dross;

But "there's no condemnation," I know I am free,
For my sins are all nailed to the cross

chorus
They are nailed to the cross,
They are nailed to the cross,

O how much He was willing to bear!
With what anguish and loss,

Jesus went to the cross!
But He carried my sins with Him there.

verse 3
I will cling to my Savior and never depart -
I will joyfully journey each day

With a song on my lips and a song in my heart,
That my sins have been taken away

chorus
They are nailed to the cross,
They are nailed to the cross,

O how much He was willing to bear!
With what anguish and loss,

Jesus went to the cross!
But He carried my sins with Him there.

chorus
They are nailed to the cross,
They are nailed to the cross,

O how much He was willing to bear!
With what anguish and loss,

end
Jesus went to the cross!
But He carried my sins with Him there.
