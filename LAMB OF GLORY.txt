LAMB OF GLORY
Words and Music by Greg Nelson and Phil McHugh

Verse 1
Hear the story from God's Word
That kings and priests and prophets heard;

There would be a sacrifice
And blood would flow to pay sin's price.

Chorus
Precious Lamb of glory.
Love's most wondrous story.

Heart of God's redemption of man;
Worship the Lamb of glory.

Verse 2
On the cross God loved the world
While all the pow'rs of hell were hurled;

No one there could understand
The One they saw was Christ the Lamb.

Chorus 
Precious Lamb of glory.
Love's most wondrous story.

Heart of God's redemption of man;
Worship the Lamb of glory.

Chorus 
Precious Lamb of glory.
Love's most wondrous story.

Heart of God's redemption of man;
Worship the Lamb of glory.

Heart of God's redemption of man;

Worship the Lamb of glory.
