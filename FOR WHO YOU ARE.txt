FOR WHO YOU ARE
Words and Music by Ruth Elaine Schram

VERSE 1
I know you think of me, as a gift from God

A precious blessing from above.

But I want you to know, that I think of you

As a reflection of God's love.

God is a perfect parent, but you are His earthly choice.

To raise me up in the way I should go.

CHORUS 
You are a blessing to my life, you are a blessing to my heart.

You are a blessing to my life,

And I thank God for who you are.

I thank God for who you are.

VERSE 2
I know you thank the Lord, I was sent to you that I'm unique and like no other.

But I want you to know, that I thank God too,

that He sent you to be my mother.

God is a perfect parent but you are His earthly choice,

To raise me up (to raise me up)

To raise me up

CHORUS 
You are a blessing to my life

You are a blessing to my heart.

You are a blessing to my life

And I thank God for who you are.

You are a blessing to my life

You are a blessing to my heart.

You are a blessing to my life,

And I thank God for who you are.

I thank God, for who you are.

A precious blessing from above.
