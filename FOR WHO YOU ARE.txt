FOR WHO YOU ARE
Words and Music By: Ruth Elaine Schram

Verse 1
I know you think of me
as a gift from God

a precious birding from above
But I want you to know

that I think of you 
as a respecting of God's love

God is the perfect parent
but you are His earthly choice

to raise me up
in the way I should go

You are a blessing to my life
you are a blessing to my heart

You are a blessing to my life
and I thank God for who you are

I thank God
for who you are

Verse 2
I know you thank the Lord 
I was sent to your

that I'm unique and like no other
But I want you to know

that I thank God, too
that He see you to be my mother

God is the perfect parent
but you are His earthly choice

to raise me up
to raise me up

Chorus
You are a blessing to my life
you are a blessing to my heart

You are a blessing to my life
and I thank God for who you are

You are a blessing to my life
you are a blessing to my heart

You are a blessing to my life
and I thank God for who you are

I thank God
for who you are

A PRECIOUS BLESSING FROM ABOVE
