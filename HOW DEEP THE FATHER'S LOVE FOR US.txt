HOW DEEP THE FATHER'S LOVE FOR US
Words and Music by Stuart Townend
Choral Setting by Larry Shackley

Verse 1
How deep the Father's love for us
how vast beyond all measure

That He should give His only Son
to make a wretch His treasure

How great the pain of searing loss?
The Father turns His face away

as wounds which mar the Chosen One
bring many sons to glory

Refrain 
How high, how wide
How deep the Father's love for us

Verse 2
Behold the man upon the cross
my sin upon His shoulders

Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice
call out among the scoffers

It was my sin that held Him there
until it was accomplished

His dying breath has brought me life
I know that it is finished

How pure, how strong 
how deep the Father's love for us

Verse 3
I will not boast in anything
no gifts, no power, no wisdom

But I will boast in Jesus Christ
his death and resurrection

Why should I gain from His reward?
I cannot give an answer

But this I know with all my heart
his wounds have paid my ransom

Refrain 
How high, how wide
How pure, how strong

How deep the Father's love for us
