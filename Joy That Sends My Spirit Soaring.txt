Intro
Joy That Sends My Spirit Soaring
By: Adam Morgan

Verse 1
O the joy of souls forgiven,
saved from death and hell and loss.

For they know what they've been given
and the depth of sins now washed.

Verse 2
Sin will soil my soul no longer.
Mercy covers guilty men.

For the Savior's blood is stronger
blood so pure He shed for them.

Chorus
The joy that sends my spirit soaring
is that God has died for me,

And I can shout with throngs adoring,
"Holy, mighty, great is He."

Verse 5
Now by grace through faith we see Him
as we run to arms unfurled,

Crying praise with joy exceeding,
"Christ has overcome the world!"

Chorus
The joy that sends my spirit soaring
is that God has died for me,

And I can shout with throngs adoring,
"Holy, mighty, great is He."

Chorus
The joy that sends my spirit soaring
is that God has died for me,

And I can shout with throngs adoring,
"Holy, mighty, great is He."

End
And I can shout with throngs adoring,
"Holy, mighty, great is He."
