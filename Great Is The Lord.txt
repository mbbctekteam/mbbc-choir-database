GREAT IS THE LORD 
Words and Music by Stephen and Rebecca Schwanke

In God's Word we read of a fallen race,  
Lost and in sin, no hope of life within.  

Then he came, the mighty conqu'ring King, 
Gave His own life to pardon ev'ry sin.

Chorus
Great is the Lord, the risen King.
Lift up your voice and gladly now proclaim:

Great is the Lord, the risen King. 
Let us adore and praise His holy name.


In a tomb they laid the Lamb of God. 
Sad was the day they viewed that awful place.

But he rose, triumphant o'er the grave, 
Fulfilled God's plan to save a fallen race.


Ev'ry knee shall bow and honor Him,
Jesus the King, exalted and adored. 

Crowns we'll cast before the sov'reign King. 
With all the saints we'll worship Christ the Lord.
