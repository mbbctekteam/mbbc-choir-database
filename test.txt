ARE YOU READY? (FOR THE CALL)

VERSE 1
The hour is approaching when the souls of man will hear.
A mighty shout resounding in the sky.
In power and great glory King Jesus will appear,
and take His children home to paradise.
It will be a celebration, for the ones who chose His name
but total separation, for the ones who turned away.

CHORUS
Are you ready for the trumpet?
Are you ready for the call?
Soon the angels will assemble to usher in the Son of God.
Will He come and find you faithful?
Will He know your name at all?
Every moment brings us closer.
Are you ready for the call?

VERSE 2
The Bible speaks of two men, who were standing in the field.
Where one is taken, one is left behind.
Two women in the kitchen one goes and one remains.
So get your house in order while there's time.
In the cross there is salvation, through the blood there is a way,
to secure your destination on that resurrection day.

CHORUS
Are you ready for the trumpet?
Are you ready for the call?
Soon the angels will assemble to usher in the Son of God.
Will He come and find you faithful?
Will He know your name at all?
Every moment brings us closer.
Are you ready for the call?

There's an urgency to reach the world.
We have no time to waste
For within the heart of mortal man the burning question now is raised.

CHORUS
Are you ready for the trumpet?
Are you ready for the call?
Soon the angels will assemble to usher in the Son of God.
Will He come and find you faithful?
Will He know your name at all?
Every moment brings us closer.
Are you ready for the call?

Will He come and find you faithful?
Will He know your name at all?
Every moment brings us closer.
Are you ready for the call?
FOR THE CALL!!!
