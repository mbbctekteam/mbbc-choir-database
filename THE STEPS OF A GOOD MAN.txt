THE STEPS OF A GOOD MAN
Words and Music by: Mac Lynch

Verse 1
Tho' dark be the night and long be the day
Lord, make me follow in Thy perfect way

Tho' cometh sorrow; tho' great be my pain
Lord, make me serve Thee, come sunshine or rain

Chorus
The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord
And He delighteth in His way.

Tho' he fall he shall not be utterly cast down
For the Lord, For the Lord,

For the Lord upholdeth Him with His hand

Verse 2
O Thou art all mighty, I am so small
Lord, make me trust Thee whatever befall

Thou art all holy; you make no mistake
Lord, make me Christ-like whatever it takes

Chorus
The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord
And He delighteth in His way.

Tho' he fall he shall not be utterly cast down
For the Lord, For the Lord,

For the Lord upholdeth Him with His hand

END
For the Lord upholdeth Him with His hand
