I'LL RUN THE RACE
Words and Music by Mac Lynch

Verse 1
The date is set, the time is come, the witnesses arrive

The course is marked, the men prepared, all weights are set aside

Positions are assumed and taken, energies now reawaken

Empty thoughts are all forsaken, I must win the prize

Chorus
I'll run this race with patience

I'll run this race with joy

I'll fix my eyes on Jesus' face

The One who saved me by His matchless grace

Verse 2
My course is set, my God designed, it all for His great cause

I will not live for selfish gain or die for man's applause

My Savior, Love, my Passion, King, His ev'ry blessed Word I'll cling

To Him, His ev'ry wish I'll bring, till Jesus calls me home

Chorus
I'll run this race with patience

I'll run this race with joy

I'll fix my eyes on Jesus' face

The One who saved me by His matchless grace

Chorus
I'll run this race with patience

I'll run this race with joy

I'll fix my eyes on Jesus' face

The One who saved me by His matchless grace

The One who saved me by His matchless grace
