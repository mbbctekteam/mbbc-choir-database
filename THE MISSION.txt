THE MISSION
Words and Music By: Jon Mohr & Randall Dennis
Choral Arr. by Steven V.

Verse 1
There's a call going out across the land in every nation

A call to those who swear allegiance to the cross of Christ

A call to true humility, to live our lives responsibly

To deepen our devotion to the cross at any price

Verse 2
Let us then be sober, moving only in the Spirit

As aliens and strangers in a hostile, foreign land

The message we're proclaiming is repentance and forgiveness

The offer of salvation to the dying race of man

Chorus
To love the Lord our God is the heartbeat of our mission

The spring from which our service overflows

Across the street or around the world

The mission's still the same

Proclaim and live the truth in Jesus' name

Verse 3
As a candle is consumed by the passion of the flame

Spilling light unsparingly throughout a darkened room

Let us burn to know Him deeper then our service flaming bright

Will radiate his passions and blaze with holy light

Chorus
To love the Lord our God is the heartbeat of our mission

The spring from which our service overflows

Across the street or around the world

The mission's still the same

Proclaim and live the truth in Jesus' name

Chorus
To love the Lord our God is the heartbeat of our mission

The spring from which our service overflows

Across the street or around the world

The mission's still the same

Proclaim and live the truth in Jesus' name

Chorus
To love the Lord our God is the heartbeat of our mission

The spring from which our service overflows

Across the street or around the world

The mission's still the same

Proclaim and live the truth in Jesus' name

To love the Lord our God is the heartbeat of our mission

To love the Lord our God is the heartbeat of, the heartbeat of our mission
