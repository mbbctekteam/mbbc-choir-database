I WILL NEVER LEAVE THEE
Words by: Charles H. Gabriel
Music by: Abie V. Pinos

Verse 1
Why should I rebel when the cross is hard to bear,

Why repine in sorrow or tremble with despair,

Jesus still is with me and His promises are sure

And thru-out the ages forever shall endure.

Chorus
I will never leave thee; Sorrow shall not grieve thee;

Trust in me completely for my words will never fail;

I will not forsake thee, foes shall not o’ertake thee;

I, the Lord, will keep thee secure against that day.

Verse 2
Though He send me trials ‘tis but to make me strong,

And the fiery furnace shall echo with my song.

In my weakness He will give strength for ev’ry day,

Loving, guiding, keeping, sustaining all the way.

Verse 3
Some day I shall see Him to know Him as He is;

Some day I shall be with the One Who died for me.

Then with all the loved ones who have journeyed before;

In His presence we shall rejoice forevermore

Chorus
I will never leave thee; Sorrow shall not grieve thee;

Trust in me completely for my words will never fail;

I will not forsake thee, Foes shall not o’ertake thee;

I, the Lord, will keep thee secure against that day.

end
I, the Lord, will keep the secure against that day.
