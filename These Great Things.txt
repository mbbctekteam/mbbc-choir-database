THESE GREAT THINGS
MBBC Choir

Verse 1
How can it be, this truth divine,
Declared by God above

That all things by His grand design
Work good for us by love

Chorus
What shall we say to these great things?
Of mystery sublime

That if He is for us we can sing
Now and for all time

Verse 2
Called by our Lord in purposed ends
No tragedy shall win

No curse for those He calls His friends
He saved us from our sins 

Chorus
What shall we say to these great things?
Of mystery sublime

That if He is for us we can sing
Now and for all time

Verse 3
Foreknown by Him with
Hearts made new

To His Son we conform
No pow'r on earth can this undo
For those He's made reborn

Chorus
What shall we say to these great things?
Of mystery sublime

That if He is for us we can sing
Now and for all time

Verse 4
First He did choose, and called He then
To surely justify

For those of the faith beyond our ken
He soon will glorify

Chorus
What shall we say to these great things?
Of mystery sublime

That if He is for us we can sing
Now and for all time
