PERFECT PEACE
MBBC Choir

When life's burdens get so heavy and it seems I'm all alone

I cast my care on Jesus and come boldly to His throne!

I find His grace sufficient when His promises I heed

For His very life He sacrificed and He lives to intercede!

Chorus:
He is the Lord of Lords! And when He speaks, Winds and waves obey!

When Jesus whispers, "Peace be still," then darkness turns to day;

and as I'm trusting in my Savior's Word, doubts and fears all cease.

And beneath the shelter if His wings, I'm at rest in perfect peace!

I will seek for souls in darkness, Calv'ry's love with them to share.

Empowered by His spirit, I will follow anywhere!

For I know what e'er befall me, my God is in control

And as my mind is stayed on Him, perfect peace He gives my soul!

Chorus:
He is the Lord of Lords! And when He speaks, Winds and waves obey!

When Jesus whispers, "Peace be still," then darkness turns to day;

and as I'm trusting in my Savior's Word, doubts and fears all cease.

And beneath the shelter if His wings, I'm at rest in perfect peace!

Chorus:
He is the Lord of Lords! And when He speaks, Winds and waves obey!

When Jesus whispers, "Peace be still," then darkness turns to day;

and as I'm trusting in my Savior's Word, doubts and fears all cease.

And beneath the shelter if His wings, I'm at rest in perfect peace!
