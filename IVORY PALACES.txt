verse1
My Lord has garments so wondrous fine,
and myrrh their texture fills;

its fragrance reached to this heart of mine,
with joy my being thrills.

chorus
Out of the ivory palaces
into a world of woe,

only his great eternal love
made my Savior go.

verse 2
His life had also its sorrows sore,
for aloes had a part;

and when I think of the cross he bore,
my eyes with teardrops start.

chorus
Out of the ivory palaces
into a world of woe,

only his great eternal love
made my Savior go.

verse 3
His garments, too, were in cassia dipped,
with healing in a touch;

each time my feet in some sin have slipped,
he took me from its clutch.

chorus
Out of the ivory palaces
into a world of woe,

only his great eternal love
made my Savior go.

verse 4
In garments glorious he will come,
to open wide the door;

and I shall enter my heavenly home,
to dwell forevermore.

chorus
Out of the ivory palaces
into a world of woe,

only his great eternal love
made my Savior go.
