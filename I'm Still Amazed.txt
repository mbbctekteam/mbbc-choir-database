I'M STILL AMAZED

verse 1
I've never got over that I am not under the bondage of sin anymore.
I'm still amazed that Jesus would pay a debt I could not afford.

I never got past that I'm free at last from the sin that made me a slave.
I still feel as much as when he first touched me.
Oh, yes! I'm still amazed!

verse 2
I'm amazed to know how far God would go to set a lost man free.
I'm still in awe that he gave it all for an old sinner like me.

I never got over that this king would shoulder my sin with all its disgrace.
Yes, Calvary's hill still gives me a thrill.
Oh, yes! I'm still amazed!

Amazed this stranger would accept a manger in trade for a kingly throne.
I'm still at a loss why he'd take the cross instead of the street of pure gold.

He's the only king who gave everything in exchange for a cold dark grave.
I still love to ponder this God given wonder.
Oh, yes! I'm still amazed!

I'm amazed to know how far God would go to set a lost man free.
I'm still in awe that he gave it all for an old sinner like me.

I've never got over that this king would shoulder my sin with all its disgrace.
Yes, Calvary's hill still gives me a thrill.
Oh, yes! I'm still amazed!

I've never got over that this king would shoulder my sin with all its disgrace.
Yes, Calvary's hill still gives me a thrill.
Oh, yes! I'm still amazed!
