BEHOLD THE LAMB
Words and Music by Megan Morgan

Behold the Lamb of God has come to take our sin.

The spotless Lamb our sacrifice, revealing God to man

Behold the love of God the love that sent the Son

For all who believe in Him eternal Life is won

Look upon His cross on high

Praise the lamb, Who came to die

Rest beneath this banner true

The spotless blood

He shed for you (He shed for you)

Behold the blood of Christ, the blood that turns away

The punishment that you deserve, Our penalty is paid

Behold the Lamb of God

the Lamb of God (Behold the risen Lamb)

Risen Lamb, conquering King (the risen conquering King)

The King of kings and Lord of lords, to Him alone we sing

Look upon His cross on high

Praise the lamb, Who came to die

Rest beneath this banner true

The spotless blood

He shed for you

Behold the Lamb of God (Behold the Lamb of God)

Behold the Lamb, of God
