I STAND REDEEMED
Words and Music by Ron Hamilton and Cheryl Reid

Verse 1
At the dawn of eternity, when the midst of time is gone
When the of Heaven gathers to begin redemption's song,

I will bow before my Savior in a body new and whole.
Then I'll rise to sing His praises while eternal ages roll.

Chorus
I stand redeemed by the blood of Jesus.
The price is paid, my debt is gone.

The chains that bound me, no longer hold me.
Because of Calv'ry, I stand redeemed.

Verse 2
As I gaze upon my Savior, at the wounds He bore for me,
I will sing of His salvation bought with blood upon the tree.

While the host of angels listen to a song they cannot sing
I will voice my praise to Jesus with the song of the redeemed.

Chorus
I stand redeemed by the blood of Jesus.
The price is paid, my debt is gone.

The chains that bound me, no longer hold me.
Because of Calv'ry, I stand redeemed.

Chorus
I stand redeemed by the blood of Jesus.
The price is paid, my debt is gone.

The chains that bound me, no longer hold me.
Because of Calv'ry, I stand redeemed.

The chains that bound me, no longer hold me

Because of Calv'ry, I stand redeemed.
