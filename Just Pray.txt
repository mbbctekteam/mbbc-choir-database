Just Pray

I was discouraged when no answer came,
For I’d prayed for years and I still saw no change;

I was ready to give up, thinking,
“What can I do?”

But when I prayed that last time,
God’s power broke through.

And prayer is just as big as God is,
Prayer as just as strong as God is strong;

Prayer can reach as far as God can reach,
Don’t ever give up, just pray, just pray.

Don’t ever give up, just pray.

We have been given a means to the throne
of the God whose potential is yet to be known;

There is no limit as to what God can do,
So just keep on praying, He’s listening to you.

And prayer is just as big as God is,
Prayer as just as strong as God is strong;

Prayer can reach as far as God can reach,
Don’t ever give up, just pray.

And prayer is just as big as God is,
Prayer as just as strong as God is strong;

Prayer can reach as far as God can reach,
Don’t ever give up, 

just pray.
Just pray.

Don’t ever give up, 
just pray.

Just pray!
