A MOTHER'S LOVE
Words and Music By: Travis Boyd

Verse 1
When she first sees a glimpse of her precious child
there are feelings she can't express

As she dreams of the future and all it could be
her eyes full with years of happiness

Chorus
Oh the love of a mother is strong and sure
The love of a mother is kind and pure

No matter what, no matter where
a living mother will always care

Born in the heart of God above
a gift like no other, the gift of a mother's love

Verse 2
Through the laughter and tears, through the joy and pain,
through the blessings that come her way

Her heart is so thankful, her spirit sings
With faith in the Lord to face each day

Chorus
Oh the love of a mother is strong and sure
The love of a mother is kind and pure

No matter what, no matter where
a living mother will always care

Born in the heart of God above
a gift like no other, the gift of a mother's love

Chorus
Oh the love of a mother is strong and sure
The love of a mother is kind and pure

No matter what, no matter where
a living mother will always care

Born in the heart of God above
a gift like no other, the gift of a mother's love

A Gift like no other
the gift of a MOTHER'S LOVE
