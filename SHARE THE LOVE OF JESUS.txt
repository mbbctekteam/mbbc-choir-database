SHARE THE LOVE OF JESUS
YP Choir

  So many people hopeless
  So many live in fear

  They wander in the darkness
  They cry a lonely tear

  So many people hurting
  And it seems nobody cares

  But you can be the difference
  With all the love you share
  
  
  Share the love of Jesus
  Let His love shine through

  Be a true reflection 
  Of the One Who lives in you

  YOu can make a difference
  If you open up your hearts

  And share the love of Jesus
  Share the love

  Share the love
  
  
  And to a world that's hurting
  YOur love can bring relief

  Encouraging the hopeless
  With comfort and with peace

  There's One Who makes a difference
  There's One Who really cares

  So point them all to Jesus
  With all the love you share
  
  
  Share the love of Jesus
  Let His love shine through

  Be a true reflection 
  of the One Who lives in you

  YOu can make a difference
  If you open up your hearts

  And share the love of Jesus
  Share the love

  Share the love
  
 
  Share the love of Jesus
  Let His love shine through

  Be a true reflection 
  of the One Who lives in you

  YOu can make a difference
  If you open up your hearts

  And share the love of Jesus
  Share the love

  Share the love
