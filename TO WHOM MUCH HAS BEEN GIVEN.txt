TO WHOM MUCH HAS BEEN GIVEN
Words and Music by Janice Akers and Susan Naylor Callaway

Verse 1
We gather in God's temple
To worship Him this hour

We honor and exalt Him
We kneel to Him in prayer

Our words are but a silence
Unless we do as He desires

For to whom much has been given
Much more shall be required

Chorus
To whom much has been given
Much more shall be required

You have given gold and silver
Will you give to Him your lives

Will you labor with your Savior
Will you do as He desires

For to whom much has been given
Much more shall be required

Verse 2
To seek the lost and hungry
And feed them with His Word

To reach out to our enemies
And embrace them with His love

Empowered and commissioned
We must do as He desires

For to whom much has been given
Much more will be required

Chorus
To whom much has been given
Much more shall be required

You have given gold and silver
Will you give to Him your lives

Will you labor with your Savior
Will you do as He desires

For to whom much has been given
Much more shall be required

Chorus
To whom much has been given
Much more shall be required

You have given gold and silver
Will you give to Him your lives

Will you labor with your Savior
Will you do as He desires

For to whom much has been given
Much more shall be required

For to whom much has been given

Much more shall be required
