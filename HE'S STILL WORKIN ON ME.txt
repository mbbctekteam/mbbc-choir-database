intro
HE'S STILL WORKIN' ON ME
Words and Music by: Joel Hemphill

Chorus
He's still workin' on me
To make me what I ought to be

It took him just a week to make the moon and stars
The sun and the earth and Jupiter and Mars

How loving and patient He must be
He's still working on me

Verse 1
There really ought to be a sign upon my heart
Don't judge him yet, there's an unfinished part

But I'll be perfect just according to His plan
Fashioned by the Master's loving hands

chorus
He's still workin' on me
To make me what I ought to be

It took him just a week to make the moon and stars
The sun and the earth and Jupiter and Mars

How loving and patient He must be
He's still working on me

Verse 2
In the mirror of His Word, reflections that I see
Makes me wonder He never gave up on me

But He loves me as I am and helps me when I pray
Remember He's the potter, I'm the clay

Chorus
He's still workin' on me
To make me what I ought to be

It took him just a week to make the moon and stars
The sun and the earth and Jupiter and Mars

How loving and patient He must be
He's still working on me

end
He's still working on me!
