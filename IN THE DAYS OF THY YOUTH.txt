IN THE DAYS OF THY YOUTH

Verse 1
I am a man, who's always procrastinating
I always do what I want

But God is watching and waiting for me.
For me to do His will

I always go with my worldly friends
And enjoy the pleasure of this world

This is not my purpose this is not right
We should act before it's too late

Chorus
Let us serve and remember thy Creator
Let us seek and strive for the goal

We should cast out the barriers 
For us to be His warriors 

In the days of thy youth we serve God

Verse 2
Sometimes we're committed Sometimes we're not
Then we complain, it is too much

We should give value and prioritize, 
The work that's given to us. 

All of us have important roles
So let us not be discourage

We are here to act as one 
For the glory of God

Chorus
Let us serve and remember thy Creator
Let us seek and strive for the goal

We should cast out the barriers 
For us to be His warriors 

In the days of thy youth we serve God

Chorus
Let us serve and remember thy Creator
Let us seek and strive for the goal

We should cast out the barriers 
For us to be His warriors 

In the days of thy youth we serve God

In the days of thy youth we serve God

In the days of thy youth we serve God
