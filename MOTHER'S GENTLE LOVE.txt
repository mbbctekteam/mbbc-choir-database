MOTHER'S GENTLE LOVE
YP Choir

Who puts a band-aid on my knee?
Who holds me close so tenderly?

Who always sees the best in me?
There’s no one like mother.

My mother’s gentle love,
my mother’s gentle love

Has taught me of God’s tender care,
and turned my eyes above.

I’ll bless her all my days 
for all her gentle ways.

Oh, how I thank my Lord above 
for my mother’s gentle love.

Who always wipes my tears away?
Who tells me I’ll be great some day?

Who cares in such a gentle way?
There’s no one like mother.

My mother’s gentle love, 
my mother’s gentle love

Has taught me of God’s tender care, 
and turned my eyes above.

I’ll bless her all my days
for all her gentle ways.

Oh, how I thank my Lord above 
for my mother’s gentle love.

My mother’s gentle love,
my mother’s gentle love

Has taught me of God’s tender care,
and turned my eyes above.

I’ll bless her all my days
for all her gentle ways.

Oh, how I thank my Lord above 
for my mother’s gentle love.
