THE ONE WHO FIRST LOVED ME
Words & Music By Adam Morgan

I know the One who sees my sorrow;
Who calms my heart and clothes my shame.

I know the One who holds tomorrow,
Who hears my prayer and heals my pain.

He is my Fortress,
He's my Father, my Freedom,

My Master, my Forgiver and Friend.
For when He died on Calvary,

He won my victory,
And now in Him I'll live eternally.

So I will love Him, and trust Him, and serve Him,
The One who first loved me 

I know the One who conquers darkness,
The source of light and truth, and grace.

I know the Fount of all forgiveness,
Who pours out life through saving faith.

He is my Fortress,
He's my Father, my Freedom,

My Master, my Forgiver and Friend.
For when He died on Calvary,

He won my victory,
And now in Him I'll live eternally.

So I will love Him, and trust Him, and serve Him,
The One who first loved me.

So I will love Him, and trust Him, and serve Him,
The One who first loved me.
