HOW CAN I KEEP FROM SINGING?
Words and Music By Chris T., Matt R., and Ed C. 
Arr. By Mary McDonald

Verse 1
There is an endless song echoes in my soul.
I hear the music ring.

And tho' the storms may come I am holding on.
To the Rock I cling.

Chorus
How can I keep from singing Your praise?
How can I ever say enough?

How amazing is Your love!
How can I keep from shouting Your name?

I know I am loved by the King,
and it makes my heart want to sing.

Verse 2
I will lift my eyes in the darkest night
for I know my Savior lives.

And I will walk with You knowing You'll see me through,
and sing the songs you give.

Chorus
How can I keep from singing Your praise?
How can I ever say enough?

How amazing is Your love!
How can I keep from shouting Your name?

I know I am loved by the King,
and it makes my heart want to sing.

Bridge:
I can sing in the troubled times
Sing when I win

I can sing when I lose my step
And I fall down again

I can sing 'cause You pick me up
Sing 'cause You're there

I can sing 'cause You hear me Lord
When I call to You in prayer

I can sing with my last breath
Sing for I know

That I'll sing with the angels
And the saints around the throne

Chorus
How can I keep from singing Your praise?
How can I ever say enough?

How amazing is Your love!
How can I keep from shouting Your name?

I know I am loved by the King,
and it makes my heart want to sing.

and it makes my heart want to sing.

Want to sing, TO SING
