A World We Never Touch

He walked along the shores of Galilee

From clay he formed the healing balm that caused the blind to see

While stones of wrath lay heavy in their

Hands he knelt to write his mercy in the sand

Jesus came to set the captive free

Showed us by the way he lived the way we need to be

Oh love is more than words could ever say

We must touch them with compassion to help them find their way

How can we reach a world we never touch

How can we show them Christ if we never show them love

Just to say we care will never be enough

How can we reach a world we never touch

Could we be so busy being saved

Trying to impress a world thats long since lost its way

We pride ourselves in being set apart but

We don't have time to touch a broken heart

Even if we found the time to care would we

Take the risk involved in always being there

Oh we hold the very thing they need so much

Sometimes the word of God can pass through just one simple touch

How can we reach a world we never touch

How can we show them Christ if we never show them love

Just to say we care will never be enough

How can we reach a world we never touch

We hide behind these walls and the security of friends

But beyond the stained glass window the world is lost in sin

How can we reach a world we never touch

How can we show them Christ if we never show them love

Just to say we care will never be enough

How can we reach a world we never touch

How can we reach a world we never touch
