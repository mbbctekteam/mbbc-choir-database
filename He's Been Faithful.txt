He's Been Faithful
Words and Music by Carol Cymbala

Sis Yna

In my moments of fear, through ev'ry pain, every tear,

there's a God who's been faithful to me

When my strength was all gone, when my heart had no song

still in love He's proved faithful to me.

Ev'ry word He's promised is true;

what I thought was impossible

I see my God do.

He's been faithful, faithful to me

looking back, His love and mercy I see.

Though in my heart, I have questioned,

even failed to believe yet, He's been faithful, faithful to me.

When my heart looked away. the many times I could not pray,

still my God, He was faithful to me.

The days I spent so selfishly,

reaching out for what pleased me;

even then, God was faithful to me.

Ev'ry time I come back to Him.

He is waiting with open arms

and I see once again.

He's been faithful, faithful to me

looking back, His love and mercy I see.

Though in my heart, I have questioned,

even failed to believe yet, He's been faithful, faithful to me.

Though, In my heart, I have questioned,

even failed to believe

yet He's been faithful, faithful

In my heart I have questioned

even failed to believe

yet, He's been faithful, faithful to me.

faithful, faithful to me.
