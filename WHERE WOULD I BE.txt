WHERE WOULD I BE?
Bro OJ and Sis Yna

Verse 1
For so long I drifted aimlessly upon the sea of life

A vessel tossing to and fro in a storm of sin and strife

'Til a hand of grace reached down to me and safely led the way

And when I think of where He brought me from, my grateful heart can say

Chorus:
Where would I be, had He not reached for me and saved me just in time?

When it seemed as though all hope was gone, He slipped His hand in mine.

From a rugged cross, I heard His sweet voice calling out my name.

And since the moment Jesus rescued me, I’ve never been the same.

Verse 2 
When I think of what He’s done for me and all He’s brought me through

I can say it’s just a miracle that only He could do

He was there in tears of sorrow in every tear of joy I cried

I wouldn’t want to live one single day without Him by my side

Chorus:
Where would I be, had He not reached for me and saved me just in time?

When it seemed as though all hope was gone, He slipped His hand in mine.

From a rugged cross, I heard His sweet voice calling out my name.

And since the moment Jesus rescued me, I’ve never been the same.

Bridge
If I praise Him for a million years and for eternity

I could never thank Him quite enough for all He’s done for me

Chorus 
Where would I be, had He not reached for me and saved me just in time?

When it seemed as though all hope was gone, He slipped His hand in mine.

From a rugged cross, I heard His sweet voice calling out my name.

And since the moment Jesus rescued me (I’m so glad He rescued me), 

I’ve never been the same
