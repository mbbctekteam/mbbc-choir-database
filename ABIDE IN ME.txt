ABIDE IN ME
Bro OJ and Sis Yna

Verse 1
Like the fruit upon the branches in its beautiful design.

Can't live without the strength of life secures upon the vine.

The Savior wants much fruit from those,

He loves and calls His own,

And bids to us a tender call from Holy scripture shown

Chorus
Abide in Me, abide in Me, The Saviors calls to one and all, Abide in Me

For I'm the vine and you're the branches, I'm the Potter, you're the clay.

Abide in Me, abide in Me.

Verse 2
May every moment of my life bring glory to Your Name.

Oh, I surrender ev'ry want and love of worldly gain.

Oh, cast me not aside as one who pants for worldly things.

But draw me close unto Your side where greatest blessing springs.

Chorus
Abide in Me, (Abide in Me), abide in Me, (abide in Me),

The Savior call to one and all, Abide in Me. 

For I'm the vine and you're the branches, I'm the Potter, you're the clay. 

Abide in Me (Abide in Me), abide in Me, 

abide in Me, 

abide in Me.
