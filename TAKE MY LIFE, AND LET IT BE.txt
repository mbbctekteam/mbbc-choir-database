TAKE MY LIFE, AND LET IT BE
Words and Music by Frances R. Havergal

Verse 1
Take my life and let it be
Consecrated, Lord, to Thee.

Take my hands, and let them move
At the impulse of thy love,

At the impulse of thy love.


Verse 2
Take my feet and let them be
Swift and beautiful for thee,

Take my voice, and let me sing
Always, only, for my King.

Always, only, for my King.

Verse 3
Take my love, my Lord, I pour
At thy feet its treasure store.

Take myself, and I will be
Ever, only, all for Thee,

Ever, only, all for Thee.

TAKE MY LIFE, AND LET IT BE
