THE ANCIENT OF DAYS
Words by Christopher Lynch and Music by Mac Lynch

Verse 1
Before the earth was formed
and angels sang His praise

Before the stars proclaimed
the wonders of His ways

The Sov'reign of eternity 
was seated on the throne

Through all the endless ages
He has ruled on high alone

Chorus
The Alpha and Omega, Almighty is His Name

The Beginning and the Ending, Forever still the same

All glory, laud, and honor, all majesty and praise

To Creator and Redeemer, To the Ancient of Days

Verse 2
To alone for fallen man
God sent His only son

Through the blood of Calvary
our salvation now is won

Now creation groans together
and this its loud refrain

One day is unveiled glory
He'll return again to reign

Chorus
The Alpha and Omega, Almighty is His Name

The Beginning and the Ending, Forever still the same

All glory, laud, and honor, all majesty and praise

To Creator and Redeemer, To the Ancient of Days

All glory, laud, and honor, all majesty and praise

To Creator and Redeemer, To the Ancient of Days

To Creator and Redeemer, 

To the Ancient of Days
