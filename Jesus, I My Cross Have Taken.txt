Jesus, I My Cross Have Taken
MBBC Choir

verse1
Jesus, I my cross have taken,
all to leave and follow you;

destitute, despised, forsaken,
you on earth once suffered, too.

Perish ev'ry fond ambition,
all I've ever hoped or known;

yet how rich is my condition,
God and heav'n are still my own!

verse2
2 Let the world despise and leave me;
they have left my Savior, too.

Human hearts and looks deceive me;
you are not, like them, untrue.

And, since you have smiled upon me,
God of wisdom, love, and might,

foes may hate and friends may shun me;
show your face, and all is bright.

verse3
3 Go, then, earthly fame and treasure!
Come, disaster, scorn, and pain!

In your service pain is pleasure,
with your favor loss is gain.

I have called you Abba, Father;
you my all in all shall be.

Storms may howl, and clouds may gather,
all must work for good to me.

verse 4
4 Haste, my soul, from grace to glory,
armed by faith and winged by prayer;

all but heav'n is transitory,
God's own hand shall guide you there.

Soon shall end this earthly story,
swift shall pass the pilgrim days,

hope soon change to heav'nly glory,
faith to sight and prayer to praise.
