RELENTLESS LOVE
Words by: Chris Anderson
Music by: Greg Habegger

Verse 1
Relentless love embraced my soul in ages past
Love undeserved, unknown, yet deep and vast.

God set His love on me on me, in spite of me
Salvation’s work is His from first to last.

Chorus
Unbounded love, unfailing love,
Love raised upon a tree

Unending love, prevailing love
My Savior’s sov'reign love for me

Verse 2
Relentless love pursued my heart, though I would hide
Was unreturned, yet undeterred by pride.

Till by a grace unsought, my rebel soul was caught
Redeemed by love that would not be denied.

Verse 3
Relentless love preserves my life from unbelief
Sustains me through my sin, my doubt, my grief.

Since Christ has done it all, though feeble, I’ll not fall,
His wounded hands hold me, the sinners’ chief.

Chorus
Unbounded love, unfailing love,
Love raised upon a tree

Unending love, prevailing love
My Savior’s sov'reign love for me

Verse 4
Relentless love transforms my soul and its delights
Exceeds the fleeting joys which once sufficed.

Held by His love for me a hold which sets me free
I have my heart’s desire, and that is Christ.

Chorus
Unbounded love, unfailing love,
Love raised upon a tree

Unending love, prevailing love
My Savior’s sov'reign love for me

Unending love, prevailing love

My Savior’s sov'reign love for me
