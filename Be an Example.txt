Be an Example
YP Choir

Many now are watching the footsteps that we take;

Many soon will follow in the choices that we make.

So let us then be faithful to be what we should be,

And leave a good example that they can clearly see. 

Chorus
Be an example of the believers in word and in conduct;

Be steadfast in love, in faith, in purity of life.

For those behind us, let us stand within the gap and make a difference in their lives;

Be an example to follow Christ.

Verse 2
Let us then be watching the weary, day by day,

Looking to encourage and to lead them in the way;

To run the race with patience;

On Jesus fix their eyes,

And challenge them with excellence, that they might win the prize.

Chorus
Be an example of the believers in word and in conduct;

Be steadfast in love, in faith, in purity of life.

For those behind us, let us stand within the gap and make a difference in their lives;

Be an example to follow Christ.

For those behind us, let us stand within the gap and make a difference in their lives;

Be an example to follow Christ.
