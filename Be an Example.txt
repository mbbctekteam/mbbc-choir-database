BE AN EXAMPLE
Words and Music By: Joe Zichterman

Verse 1
Many now are watching
The footsteps that we take

Many soon will follow
In the choices that we make

So let us then be faithful
To be what we should be

And leave a good example
That they can clearly see

Chorus
Be an example of the believers
In word and in conduct

Be steadfast in love
In faith in purity of life

For those behind us
Let us stand within the gap

And make a diff'rence in their lives
Be an example to follow Christ

Verse 2
Let us then be watching
The weary day by day

Looking to encourage
And to lead them in the way

To run the race with patience
On Jesus fix their eyes

And challenge them with excellence
That they might win the prize

Chorus
Be an example of the believers
In word and in conduct

Be steadfast in love
In faith in purity of life

For those behind us
Let us stand within the gap

And make a diff'rence in their lives
Be an example to follow Christ

For those behind us
Let us stand within the gap

And make a diff'rence in their lives
Be an example to follow Christ

Be an example to follow Christ
