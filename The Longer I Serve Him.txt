Intro
THE LONGER I SERVE HIM

Verse 1
Since I started for the Kingdom,
Since my life He controls,

Since I gave my heart to Jesus,
The longer I serve Him,
The sweeter He grows.

Chorus
The longer I serve Him, the sweeter He grows,
The more that I love Him, more love He bestows;

Each day is like heaven, my heart overflows,
The longer I serve Him, the sweeter He grows.

Verse 2
Ev'ry need He is supplying,
Plenteous grace He bestows;

Ev'ry day my way gets brighter,
The longer I serve Him,
The sweeter He grows.

Chorus
The longer I serve Him, the sweeter He grows,
The more that I love Him, more love He bestows;

Each day is like heaven, my heart overflows,
The longer I serve Him, the sweeter He grows.

Chorus
The longer I serve Him, the sweeter He grows,
The more that I love Him, more love He bestows;

Each day is like heaven, my heart overflows,
The longer I serve Him, the sweeter He grows.

end
Each day is like heaven, my heart overflows,
The longer I serve Him, the sweeter He grows.

The Longer I Serve Him
