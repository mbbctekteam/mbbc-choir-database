MY GOD IS GOOD
Words by Tracey Hager and Music by Faye LÃ³pez

VERSE 1
Where can I find hope in all the trials that you bring?
How can i have joy while suffring loss?
When my soul's in prison how can I find cause to sing?
How did you find peace while on the cross?

CHORUS
Tho' I may never understand, I'll trust will all my heart
And from the course that You have planned I never want to part
In searching for Your way and wisdom, teach me if You would
That for all time, in every place, my God is good

VERSE 2
How can You give pardon to a life's that full of sin?
Where is there a refuge from my cares?
Is there any healing for a void that lies within
When silence is Your answer to my prayers?

CHORUS
Tho' I may never understand, I'll trust will all my heart
And from the course that You have planned I never want to part
In searching for Your way and wisdom, teach me if You would
That for all time (that for all time)
In every place, (in every place)
my God is good
