Verse 1
The Lord, is my Shepherd, my guardian and my guide.

I shall never hunger, all my needs He will provide.

Even though I walk in darkness, His love will be my light.

And I will go where He leads me. I will serve Him each day of my life

CHORUS
I will praise Him, with every breath I take.

I will honor Him, in every choice I make.

I will live for the glory of the Lord.

Yes, I will live for the glory of the Lord.

Verse 2
Though I often wander, He gently takes my hand.

And leads me to living waters that I may rest in Him.

Still, He calls me onward to share the gift of life.

And I will go where He leads me, I will serve Him each day of my life.

CHORUS
I will praise Him, with every breath I take.

I will honor Him, in every choice I make.

I will live for the glory of the Lord.

Yes, I will live for the glory of the Lord.

BRIDGE
I will arise to answer Godâ€™s call.

I will go forth and give Him my all.

I will be faithful and be strong as I live,

For the glory of the Lord.

CHORUS
I will praise Him, with every breath I take.

I will honor Him, in every choice I make.

I will live for the glory of the Lord.

Yes, I will live for the glory of the Lord

Yes, I will live
