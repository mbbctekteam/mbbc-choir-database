A SERVANT'S HEART
Words and Music by Ron Hamilton

VERSE 1
Make me a servant like you, dear Lord,

Living for others each day

Humble and meek, helping the weak,

Loving in all that I say.

CHORUS
Give me, Lord, a servant's heart

Here's my life, take every part.

Give me, Lord, a servant's heart.

Help me draw so close to You

That Your love comes shining through

Give me, Lord, a servant's heart,

Give me, Lord, a servant's heart.

VERSE 2
Make me a witness like You, dear Lord,

Showing the love of the cross,

Sharing Your Word till all have heard,

Serving whatever the cost heart.

CHORUS
Give me, Lord, a servant's heart

Here's my life, take every part.

Give me, Lord, a servant's heart.

Help me draw so close to You

That Your love comes shining through

Give me, Lord, a servant's heart.

CHORUS
Give me, Lord, a servant's heart

Here's my life, take every part.

Give me, Lord, a servant's heart.

Help me draw so close to You

That Your love comes shining through

Give me, Lord, a servant's heart,

Give me, Lord, a servant's heart.
