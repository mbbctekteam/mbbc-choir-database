COMPLETE IN THEE

Words by Aaron R. Wolfe and James Gray
Music by Ben Nyce

Chorus
Yea, justified! O blessed thought!
And sanctified! Salvation wrought!

Thy blood hath pardon bought for me,
And glorified, I too, shall be!

Verse 1
Complete in Thee! no work of mine
May take, dear Lord, the place of Thine;

Thy blood hath pardon bought for me,
And I am now complete in Thee.

Verse 2
Complete in Thee! no more shall sin,
Thy grace hath conquered, reign within;

Thy voice shall bid the tempter flee,
And I shall stand complete in Thee.

Chorus
Yea, justified! O blessed thought!
And sanctified! Salvation wrought!

Thy blood hath pardon bought for me,
And glorified, I too, shall be!

Verse 3
Complete in Thee each want supplied,
And no good thing to me denied;

Since Thou my portion, Lord, wilt be,
I ask no more, complete in Thee. 

Verse 4
Dear Saviour! when before Thy bar
All tribes and tongues assembled are,

Among Thy chosen will I be,
At Thy right hand, complete in Thee.

Chorus
Yea, justified! O blessed thought!
And sanctified! Salvation wrought!

Thy blood hath pardon bought for me,
And glorified, I too, shall be!
