HOW CAN I FEAR 

Verse 1 
When shadows fall and the night covers all
There are things that my eyes cannot see.
I never fear, for the Saviour is near.
My LORD abides with me!

Chorus
How can I fear Jesus is near!
He ever watches over me!
Worries all cease; He gives me peace.
How can I fear with Jesus?

Verse 2
When I'm alone and I face the unknown
And I fear what the future may be,
I can depend on the strength of my Friend!
He walks along with me.

Verse 3
Jesus is King! He controls everything!
He is with me each night and each day.
I trust my soul to the Saviour's control;
He drives all fear away!

Chorus
How can I fear Jesus is near!
He ever watches over me!
Worries all cease; He gives me peace.
How can I fear with Jesus?

Chorus
How can I fear Jesus is near!
He ever watches over me!
Worries all cease; He gives me peace.
How can I fear with Jesus?

How can I fear with Jesus?
