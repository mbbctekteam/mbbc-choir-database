Verse 1
Take your stand with the Son of God,
O be faithful to His name;

Plant your feet on the Word of God,
It shall ever be the same.

Dare to stand alone for Christ,
Claim the blood He sacrificed;

Lift the name of Jesus high,
Press onward to the sky.

We are marching toward our goal,
All the world before us lies;

With our Captain we shall endure,
Till we gain the heav'nly prize.

Dare to stand alone for Christ,
Claim the blood He sacrificed;

Press onward to the sky.

Verse 3
Join us, Christian, and take your stand,
Daily feast upon His Word;

Face the foe with your sword in hand,
Till the vict'ry shout is heard.

Dare to stand alone for Christ,
Claim the blood He sacrificed;

Lift the name of Jesus high,
Press onward to the sky.

Dare to stand alone for Christ,
