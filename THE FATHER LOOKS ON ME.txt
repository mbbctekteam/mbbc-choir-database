THE FATHER LOOKS ON ME
Words and Music by: Chris Anderson, Rebekah Anderson

Verse 1
The Father looks on me and sees
Not what I was or am;

He views the righteousness of Christ,
And not my cursed sin.

The Father looks and pities me;
He knows that I am dust.

He treats me not as I deserve,
But as though I were just.

Verse 2
The Father looks on me and gives
A loaf and not a stone.

He showers me with perfect gifts,
For all my needs are known.

The Father looks on me with love
A child He's welcomed home.

He found an orphan, poor and soiled,
Yet claimed me as His own.

Verse 3
The Father looks for me with hope,
For me, His wayward son.

I stand afar, detained by shame;
He cries for joy and runs!

The Father looks on me and smiles,
For it is Christ He sees;

"This is my own beloved son,
In whom I am well pleased."

"This is my own beloved son,

In whom I am well pleased."
