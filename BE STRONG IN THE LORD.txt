BE STRONG IN THE LORD
Words by Linda Lee Johnson and Music by Tom Fettke

Verse 1
Be strong in the Lord and be of good courage
Your defender is He, will be always the same
Mount up with wings, as the eagle ascending
Victory is sure when you call on His name

Chorus
Be strong, be strong, be strong in the Lord
And be of good courage, for He is your guide
Be strong, be strong, be strong in the Lord
And rejoice for the victory is yours

Verse 2
Put on the armor the Lord has provided
Place your defense in His unfailing care
Trust Him for He will be with you in battle
Lighting your path to avoid every snare

Verse 3
Be strong in the Lord, and be of good courage
Your mighty commander will vanquish the foe
Fear not the battle for the victory is always His
He will protect you wherever you go

Chorus 
Be strong, be strong, be strong in the Lord
And be of good courage, for He is your guide
Be strong, be strong, be strong in the Lord
And rejoice for the victory is yours

Be strong, be strong, be strong in the Lord
And rejoice for the victory is yours

BE STRONG
