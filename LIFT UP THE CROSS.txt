Verse 1
Lift up the cross.

Carry the light of the gospel

Always proclaim GOD's Holy

unchangeable Word

Weep for the lost.

Pray they will heed to the Spirit's call

Preach to all men

until every ear has heard

Lift up the cross.

Share the good news of salvation

Multitudes long to know

there is hope for their souls

Give of your best,

fervently seeking the Kingdom

Over all else, know Christ,

and make HIM known

Chorus
Lift up the cross, high above

The clouds of deception,

doubt and confusion

Tell the world God so loved

He gave us His Son

He gave us His Son

Verse 2
Lift up the cross,

scorners and skeptics are watching

Donâ€²t be afraid. There's power

in JESUS' name

Stand for the faith,

having no need for apology

Speak forth the truth,

Boldly and unashamed

Chorus
Lift up the cross, high above

The clouds of deception

doubt and confusion

Tell the world God so loved

He gave us His Son.

He gave us His Son.

Verse 3
Lift up the cross.

There is no greater honor

thank to obey the call, no matter the cose

Lay down Your life,

fully secured to serve the Lord

Live all the rest of your days

to lift up the cross

Lift up the cross
(Lift Him up, Let them see Jesus)

The cross
(Stand for the gospel)

Lift up the cross
(Lift Him up, Let them see Jesus)

The cross
(Stand for the gospel)
