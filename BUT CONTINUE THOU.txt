BUT CONTINUE THOU
Words and Music by: Mac Lynch

Verse 1
These days are drawing close to an end.
God has been working on you my dear friend.

Your heart has been tender, tho' others' stone cold.
For you who are hungry a message we hold.

Chorus
But continue thou in the things thou hast learned.
But continue thou in the things thou hast learned.

May ev'ry seed sown in love here be reaped in your life.
But continue thou in the things thou has learned.

Verse 2
Now to the journey You must now face.
Champions He'll make you if you run His race.

Your strength is made perfect when it is so weak.
His grace is sufficient when His face you seek.

Chorus
But continue thou in the things thou hast learned.
But continue thou in the things thou hast learned.

May ev'ry seed sown in love here be reaped in your life.
But continue thou in the things thou hast learned.

end
May ev'ry seed sown in love here be reaped in your life.
But continue thou in the things thou hast learned.
