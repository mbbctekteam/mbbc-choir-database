Verse 1
I don't understand how a God so divine

Could lower Himself to a life such as mine

And consider me worth ev'ry minute of time

To rescue a sinner like me

When I think of my savior alone on the cross

I know without him

That my life would be lost

If he had not been willing to suffer the cost

To rescue a sinner like me

Chorus
To rescue a sinner like me, Lord

To rescue a sinner like me

He abandoned his throne and his kingdom above

To rescue a sinner like me

Verse 2

My mind is so limited I cannot see

The reason he died and arose just for me

So unworthy was I, yet he cam willingly

To rescue a sinner like me

Chorus
To rescue a sinner like me, Lord

To rescue a sinner like me

He abandoned his throne and his kingdom above

To rescue a sinner like me

To rescue a sinner as worthless as I

And give me a reason to sing

It's so hard to believe, but it happened to me

Hallelujah to Jesus my king

My King!

Chorus
To rescue a sinner like me, Lord

To rescue a sinner like me

He abandoned his throne and his kingdom above

To rescue a sinner like me

He abandoned his throne and his kingdom above

To rescue a sinner like me

A sinner like me

A SINNER LIKE ME
