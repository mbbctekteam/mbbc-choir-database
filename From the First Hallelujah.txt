Intro
From the First Hallelujah
YP Choir

verse 1
Often in a rev'rent time we say amen"
And when our hearts are joyful, "hallelujahs" ring again,

In old camp meetings on the grass or temples built by men,
A saint shouts "hallelujah" and we all join in.

chorus
From the first hallelujah to the last amen
I'll praise the Lord and then I'll praise Him again

sharing the Love of Jesus With all men
From the first hallelujah to the last amen.

verse 2
We say "hallelujah"; .that means "praise the Lord."
And "amen" simply tells us that our hearts are in accord.

So if You feel restricted, strike a brand new chord,
Let's all agree together now to praise the Lord

Chorus
From the first hallelujah to the last amen,
I'll praise the Lord and then I'll praise Him again

Sharing the love of Jesus with all men
From the first hallelujah to the last amen.

verse 3
Don't you be embarrassed now to say "amen,"
And don't you ever hesitate tto join right in.

If you can't praise the savior now, you'll be embarrassed then
When we sing "hallelujah" and the angels say "amen."

Chorus
From the first hallelujah to the last amen,
I'll praise the Lord and then I'll praise Him again

Sharing the love of Jesus with all men
From the first hallelujah to the last amen.

End
Amen! Amen! Amen!
