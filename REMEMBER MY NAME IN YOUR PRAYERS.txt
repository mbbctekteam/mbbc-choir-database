REMEMBER MY NAME IN YOUR PRAYERS
YP Men

Verse 1
If you should see me someday on life's journey
Weary and tired, sad and forlorn

If you will only remember my name in your prayers
I know that someday I'll make it on home

Chorus
The load I must carry may sometimes get heavy to bare
Days and nights may seem weary and long

But if you'll only remember my name in your prayers
I know that someday I'll make it on home

Verse 2
If you should see me someday heavy laiden
Bending low, wan'dring along

If you will only remember my name in your prayers
I know that someday I'll make it on home

Chorus
The load I must carry may sometimes get heavy to bare
Days and nights may seem weary and long

But if you'll only remember my name in your prayers
I know that someday I'll make it on home

Chorus
The load I must carry may sometimes get heavy to bare
Days and nights may seem weary and long

But if you'll only remember my name in your prayers
I know that someday I'll make it on home

But if you'll only remember my name in your prayers

I know that someday I'll make it on home
