"I LOVE YOU, LORD"
By Ron "Patch" Hamilton

I thank You, Lord, for all You've done,
I don't deserve Your love;

When I was lost You saw my need,
And left Your home above.

I love You, Lord, I love You, Lord,
Because of Calvary;

I love You, Lord, I love You, Lord,
You're everything to me.

You proved Your love on Calvary,
You bore my sin and shame;

I'll live for You through all my days,
I'll praise Your holy name! 

I love You, Lord, I love You, Lord,
Because of Calvary;

I love You, Lord, I love You, Lord,
You're everything to me.
