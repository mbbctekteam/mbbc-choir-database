KEEP THY HEART 
Sis Yna and Sis Marion

Verse 1
Now on this mountaintop we have gleaned so many things.

We've been drawn closer to His heart, a place that trial brings.

We have seen vict'ry over sin, and witnessed answered prayer.

We have known Christ be our only strength, found His Word a jewel rare.

Chorus
Keep your heart, keep your heart, keep your heart with all diligence.

Keep it clean, keep it pure, make your love for Christ endure.

Guard your ears; guard your eyes; Pressing onward to the prize.

Lest you fall, lest you fail, make your love for Christ prevail.

Verse 2
Now from this mountaintop to your valley here below,

You have all of the armory to defeat that wicked foe.

The vict'ry is at your command, Your prayers He'll answer still.

Be the guardian of your only heart, Heed this Word, His perfect will.

Chorus
Keep your heart, keep your heart, keep your heart with all diligence.

Keep it clean, keep it pure, make your love for Christ endure.

Guard your ears; guard your eyes; Pressing onward to the prize.

Lest you fall, lest you fail, make your love for Christ prevail.

Lest you fall, lest you fail, make your love for Christ prevail.
