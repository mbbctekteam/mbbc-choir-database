BECAUSE OF YOU LYRICS
Sis Trishia and Sis KC

So many nights I’d lie awake and listen 
as you would talk to God and call my name

You’d hold your Bible like a priceless treasure, 
and ev’ry promise you would claim

I knew that you were praying for my future
Those distant years ahead you couldn’t see

But through the eyes of faith you had assurance
That God would bless the plans He had for me

Because you prayed, I’ve found my faith in Jesus
Because you loved, I learned to love Him, too

I don’t know where my life would be if you had never shown to me
What God has done, what God can do

Now my life’s forever changed, because of you.

I’m grateful for the life you’ve lived before me
A life so firmly fashioned by God’s grace 

For you would always leave the touch of Jesus
In ev’ry heart, on ev’ry face

Because you gave, I found the joy of giving
Because you cared, I care for others too.

I don’t know where my life would be if you had never let me see
Your love of Jesus shining though

Now my life’s forever changed, because of you.
God has blessings far beyond all measure

Unlimited and boundless from above,
But of them all, by far His greatest treasure 

Is the grace and beauty of a mother’s love
Because you stayed, I never felt forsaken

Because you shared, I learned that I should too
I don’t know where my life would be if you had never shown to me

The God you loved, the God you knew
Now my life’s forever changed, because of you

Now my life’s forever changed, BECAUSE OF YOU
