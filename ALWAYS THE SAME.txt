Always The Same
Words and Music By Ron Hamilton

MBBC Choir

I am His, He is mine; Jesus knows my name.

I can rest in His arms; He’s always the same.

When I fall, when I call, Jesus takes my hand.

Cleansing me, lifting me, He helps me to stand.

Always the same, (Always the same)

O praise His name, (O praise His name)

Jesus never changes; (Jesus is always the same) He’s always the same. 

Always together,  (Always together), His love is forever (Love is forever)

Jesus never changes; ( Jesus is always the same)He’s always the same.

In His love, I’m secure; we shall never part.

In His Word I will trust and give Him all my heart.

In the dark of the night, when my heart would fear,

Lovingly, tenderly, my Saviour is near.

Always the same, (Always the same)

O praise His name, (O praise His name)

Jesus never changes; (Jesus is always the same) He’s always the same. 

Always together,  (Always together), His love is forever (Love is forever)

Jesus never changes; ( Jesus is always the same)He’s always the same.

Always the same, (Always the same)

O praise His name, (O praise His name)

Jesus never changes; (Jesus is always the same) He’s always the same. 

Always together,  (Always together), His love is forever (Love is forever)

Jesus never changes; ( Jesus is always the same)He’s always the same.

Jesus is always the same (He’s always the same)
