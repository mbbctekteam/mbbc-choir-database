Words and Music by Cindy Berry

Verse 1
By gentle waters, You will safely lead me,
in green pastures feed me, knowing what is best.

Though I often stray, wander far away,
I can hear you say, "Come to me and rest"

Verse 2
There's no need to fear when the Shepherd's near
When your voice I hear, | find comfort sure.

Free from all alarm, sheltered from all harm,
safely in your arms, I can rest secure.

Verse 3
Jesus, loving Shepherd, You'll forsake me never.
In you flock forever, I am not alone, not alone.

Though the darkness hide me, You are close beside me.
Gentle shepherd, guide me til l'm safely home.

Amen
