Verse 1
In this world of darkness
We are given light

Hope for all the dying
How will they know

How will they know
That Jesus loves them

And He died to save them

Chorus
Carry the Light
Carry the Light

Go and tell the children
They are precious in His sight

Carry the Light
Carry the Light

Go and preach the gospel
'Til there is no more night

In the name of Jesus Christ
Carry the Light

Verse 2
Count them by the millions
Blinded slaves to sin

Inside they are dying
How will they know

How will they know
That Jesus loves them

And His heart is breaking

Chorus
Carry the Light
Carry the Light

Go and tell the children
They are precious in His sight

Carry the Light
Carry the Light

Go and preach the gospel
'Til there is no more night

In the name of Jesus Christ
Carry the Light

Go ye into all the world
Go ye into all the world

And carry the Light
Carry the Light

Go and tell the children
They are precious in His sight

Carry the light
Carry the light

Go and preach the gospel
'Til there is no more night

In the name of Jesus Christ
Carry the light

In the name of Jesus Christ
Carry the light

In the name of Jesus Christ
Carry the light

The Light
CARRY THE LIGHT
