Verse 1
Ev'ry promise we can make,
ev'ry prayer and step of faith

Ev'ry difference we will make
is only by His grace

Ev'ry mountain we will climb
ev'ry ray of hope we shine

Ev'ry blessing left behind
is only by His grace

Chorus
Grace alone which God supplies
Strength unknown He will provide

Christ in us our Cornerstone
We will go forth in grace alone

Verse 2
Ev'ry soul we long to reach
Ev'ry heart we hope to teach

Ev'rywhere we share His peace
Is only by His grace

Ev'ry loving word we say
Ev'ry tear we wipe away

Ev'ry sorrow turned to praise
Is only by His grace

Chorus
Grace alone which God supplies
Strength unknown He will provide

Christ in us our Cornerstone
We will go forth in grace alone

Chorus
Grace alone which God supplies
Strength unknown He will provide

Christ in us our Cornerstone
We will go forth in grace alone

We will go forth in grace alone 

We will go forth in grace alone
