WE PRAISE, THEE, O GOD, OUR REDEEMER
MBBC Choir

Verse 1
We praise you, O God, our Redeemer, Creator;
in grateful devotion our tribute we bring;

We lay it before You; we kneel and adore You;
We bless Your holy name: glad praises we sing.

Verse 2
We worship You, God of our fathers, we bless You,
Through life's storm and tempest our guide You have been;

when perils o'ertake us, you will not forsake us,
And with your help, O Lord, our battles we win.

Verse 3
With voices united our praises we offer,
And gladly our songs of thanksgiving we raise;

With you, Lord, beside us, Your strong arm will guide us,
To you, our great Redeemer, forever be praise.

End 1
To you, our great Redeemer, forever be praise.

End 2
We Praise, thee, O God, Our Redeemer
