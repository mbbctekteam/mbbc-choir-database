"The Only Real Peace"
Words and Music By: Lynda Randle

Verse 1
Life is a few days of trouble a wise man once said,
But I'll not complain for, I'm sheltered, I'm clothed, and I'm fed.

But many's the trial my wants and my dreams put me through,
And the only real peace that I have, dear Lord, is in You.

Chorus
The only real peace that I have, dear Lord, is in You.
The only real peace that I have, dear Lord, is in You.

With all life's temptations, I need You, and I know I do.
'Cause the only real peace that I have, dear Lord, is in You.

Verse 2
The higher I've soared in my dreams, the harder I fall
And sometimes I've wondered if dreams are worth dreaming at all.

Then my disppointments can't keep me blinded and blue
Not when I'm reminded of sweet peace I have, Lord, in You.

Chorus
The only real peace that I have, dear Lord, is in You.
The only real peace that I have, dear Lord, is in You.

With all life's temptations, I need You, and I know I do.
'Cause the only real peace that I have, dear Lord, is in You.

With all life's temptations, I need You, and I know I do.
'Cause the only real peace that I have, dear Lord, is in You.
