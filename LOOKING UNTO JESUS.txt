LOOKING UNTO JESUS
Words and Music by Mac Lynch

Verse 1
I’m looking unto Jesus,
He’s my Savior & my friend

The Author & Creator,
beginning & the end

Oh my eyes are fixed upon Him
He who died to take my place

My heart is bent to serve Him;
His pattern I must trace

Chorus
I’m looking unto Jesus
I’m feasting on His word

I’ll turn not to the left the right;
I will not face the rear

When friend or foe forsake me,
Lord, I will not shrink in fear

I am looking to the King of Kings

Verse 2
I’m looking unto Jesus
He who laid out every course

He ran the race before us,
of strength, the runner’s source.

Oh consider with attention
He who took a servant’s form

Completed the requirement,
To His Father’s will conformed

Verse 3
I’ll run the race with patience
Endure what God deems best

I’ll lay aside the sinful weights
that make me fail the test

I will search the Holy Scriptures
that can every problem solve

I’ll serve my God and Savior
And that with great resolve

Chorus
I’m looking unto Jesus
I’m feasting on His word

I’ll turn not to the left the right;
I will not face the rear

When friend or foe forsake me,
Lord, I will not shrink in fear

I am looking to the King of Kings

I am looking to the King of Kings
