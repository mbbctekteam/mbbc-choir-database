WHAT MANNER OF LOVE
(Text by Eric J. Alexander; Tune by Paul S. Jones)

O Christ, what love is this,
That all your loved ones know;
That brought you down from highest bliss
To live in such a world as this,
The Father’s will to do,
The Father’s will to do.

O Christ, what burdens these,
You bore on your own soul;
Our guilt, our judgment and God’s wrath:
The man of sorrows died our death,
And all to make us whole,
And all to make us whole.

O Christ, what dread reproach!
The Holy One made sin,
The King of Kings with thorns is crowned,
The Lord of heav’n and earth disowned,
And sinners welcomed in,
And sinners welcomed in!

O Christ, what joy is this?
The joy of sins forgiv’n,
No condemnation now we have,
Nor dark despair beyond the grave,
Instead, the hope of heav’n,
Instead, the hope of heav’n.

O Christ, what glory waits
The objects of your love!
No eye has seen nor ear has heard,
What God in his great grace prepared,
In that blest world above,
In that blest world above.
