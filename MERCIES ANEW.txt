MERCIES ANEW
Sis Rachael

verse 1
Every morning that breaks, there are mercies anew
Every breath that I take, is your faithfulness proved

And at the end of each day, when my labors are through
I will sing of Your mercies anew.

verse 2
When I’ve fallen and strayed, there were mercies anew
For you sought me in love and my heart you pursued

In the face of my sin Lord, You never withdrew
So I sing of Your mercies anew.

verse 3
And Your mercies, they will never end
For ten thousand years they’ll remain

And when this world’s beauty has passed away
Your mercies will be unchanged.

verse 4
And when the storms swirl and rage, there are mercies anew
In affliction and pain, You will carry me through

And at the end of my days when Your throne fills my view
I will sing of Your mercies anew.

verse 5
And Your mercies, they will never end
For ten thousand years they’ll remain

And when this world’s beauty has passed away
Your mercies will be unchanged.

verse 6
And when the storms swirl and rage, there are mercies anew
In affliction and pain, You will carry me through

And at the end of my days when Your throne fills my view
I will sing of Your mercies anew.
