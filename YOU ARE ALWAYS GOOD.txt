intro
Though my eyes can't see,
You are always good, only good

Verse 1
Looking back, I can see Your fingerprints
Upon my life always seeking my best

There were times when Your way would make no sense
But as You said, You have never left

Chorus
You are always good, You are only good
You are always good to me

Though my eyes can't see, help my heart believe
You are always only good

Verse 2
Looking in, I can see my frailty
My sin is great, and my strength is so small

Still You stay, and Your mercy shelters me
You hold my hand, and You hear my call

Chorus
You are always good, You are only good
You are always good to me

Though my eyes can't see, help my heart believe
You are always only good

Verse 3
Looking up, I can see Your sympathy
I doubt myself, but I'm sure of Your love

Lavish grace was poured out at Calvary
Securing me for our home above

Chorus
You are always good, You are only good
You are always good to me

Though my eyes can't see, help my heart believe
You are always only good

end
You are always good, only good
You are good

end
