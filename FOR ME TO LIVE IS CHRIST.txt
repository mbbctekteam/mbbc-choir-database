FOR ME TO LIVE IS CHRIST
Words and Music by J. White

YP Choir

Verse 1
For me to live is Christ, to die is gain,
To know His Word and walk His narrow way;

There is no peace, no joy, no thrill
Like walking in His will,

For me to live is Christ, to die is gain

Verse 2
Once my heart was full of sin and shame,
Till someone told me Jesus came to save;

When he said, "Come unto Me," 
He set my poor heart free,

For me to live is Christ, to die is gain.

Verse 3
There are things that i still do not know,
but of this one thing I'm completely sure;

That He Who called me on that day
Washed all my sins away,

For me to live is Christ, to die is gain.

For me to live is Christ, to die is gain,
To know His Word and walk His narrow way;

There is no peace, no joy, no thrill
Like walking in His will,

For me to live is Christ, to die is gain

There is no peace, no joy, no thrill

Like walking in His will,

For me to live is Christ, to die is gain
