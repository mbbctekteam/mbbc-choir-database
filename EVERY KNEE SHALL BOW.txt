EVERY KNEE SHALL BOW
(Text by Chris Anderson; Tune by Molly Ijames)

Every knee shall bow to Thee,
Precious Lamb who bowed for me.
No more shall they kneel in scorn;
No more shall Thy crown be thorns.
Shame is shamed, and fear has fled,
For Thou art risen from the dead.
Every knee shall bow to Thee,
Precious Lamb who bowed for me.

Every tongue shall sing to Thee,
Risen Lamb who lives in me.
Vacant is Thy jail-like tomb;
Vanquished are its chains, its gloom.
Thou art free, thus so am I,
And through Thy triumph death shall die!
Every tongue shall sing to Thee,
Risen Lamb who lives in me.

Every tribe shall come to Thee,
Worthy Lamb, so speak through me.
Kingdoms, kindreds, tribes, and tonguesâ€”
Out of each shall praise be sung.
Make from every shade and race
A tapestry of lavish grace!
Every tribe shall come to Thee,
Worthy Lamb, so speak through me.
