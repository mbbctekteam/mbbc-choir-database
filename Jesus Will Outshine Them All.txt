JESUS WILL OUTSHINE THEM ALL
Words and Music by: Gordon Jensen

Chorus
Mansions will glisten on the hills of Glory
happy reunions on streets of gold;

Angel choirs singing glad praises forever
but Jesus will outshine them all.

Verse 1
Oh what glory awaits me in heaven's bright city
when I get there such sights I'll behold.

A million scenes of rare beauty
will demand that I view them,

Still Jesus will outshine them all!

Chorus
Mansions will glisten on the hills of Glory
happy reunions on streets of gold;

Angel choirs singing glad praises forever
but Jesus will outshine them all.

Verse 2
The sparkling river is flowing, happy faces all glowing
land of splendor where night never falls.

The golden glass gives reflection
to that city's perfection

Sill Jesus will outshine them all.

Chorus
Mansions will glisten on the hills of Glory
happy reunions on streets of gold;

Angel choirs singing glad praises forever
but Jesus will outshine them all.

Angel choirs singing glad praises forever
but Jesus will outshine them all.
