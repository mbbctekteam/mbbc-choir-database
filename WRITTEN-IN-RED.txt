WRITTEN IN RED
Words and Music by: Gordon Jensen

Chorus
I love you, I love you
That's what Calvary said

I love you, I love you
I love you, written in red

Verse 1
In letters of crimson, God wrote His love
On a hillside so long, long ago

For you and for me Jesus died
And love's greatest story was told

Chorus
I love you, I love you
That's what Calvary said

I love you, I love you
I love you, written in red

Verse 2
Down through the ages, God wrote His love
With the same hands that suffered and bled

Giving all that He had to give
A message so easily read

Chorus
I love you, I love you
That's what Calvary said

I love you, I love you
I love you, written in red

end
I LOVE YOU, WRITTEN IN RED
