JESUS, HOLD MY HAND
YP MEN

Verse 1
As I travel through this pilgrim land
There is a friend who walks with me

Leads me safely through the sinking sand
It is the Christ at Calvary

This would be my prayer dear Lord each day
To help me do the best I can

For I need Thy light to guide me day and night
Blessed Jesus, hold my hand

Chorus
Jesus, hold my hand
(Blessed Jesus, hold my hand)

I need thee every hour
(Yes I need Thee every hour)

Through this pilgrim land
(Through this land this pilgrim land)

Protect me by thy power
(By Thy saving power)
 
Hear my feeble plea
(Hear my plea my feeble plea)

O Lord look down on me
(Lord, dear Lord look down on me)

When I kneel in prayer I 
hope to meet you there

(When I kneel in prayer)
Blessed Jesus, hold my hand

Verse 2
Let me travel in the light divine
That I may see the blessed way

Keep me that I may be wholly Thine
And sing redemption's song some day

I will be a soldier brave and true
And ever firmly take a stand

As I onward go and daily meet the foe
Blessed Jesus, hold my hand
 
Verse 3
When I wander thru the valley dim
Toward the setting of the sun

Lead me safely to a land of rest
If I a crown of life have won

I have put my faith in Thee, dear Lord
That I may reach the golden strand

There's no other friend pn whom I can depend
Blessed Jesus, hold my hand
 
Chorus
Jesus, hold my hand
(Blessed Jesus, hold my hand)

I need thee every hour
(Yes I need Thee every hour)

Through this pilgrim land
(Through this land this pilgrim land)

Protect me by thy power
(By Thy saving power)
 
Hear my feeble plea
(Hear my plea my feeble plea)

O Lord look down on me
(Lord, dear Lord look down on me)

When I kneel in prayer I 
hope to meet you there

(When I kneel in prayer)
Blessed Jesus, hold my hand

Chorus
Jesus, hold my hand
(Blessed Jesus, hold my hand)

I need thee every hour
(Yes I need Thee every hour)

Through this pilgrim land
(Through this land this pilgrim land)

Protect me by thy power
(By Thy saving power)
 
Hear my feeble plea
(Hear my plea my feeble plea)

O Lord look down on me
(Lord, dear Lord look down on me)

When I kneel in prayer I 
hope to meet you there

(When I kneel in prayer)
Blessed Jesus, hold my hand
