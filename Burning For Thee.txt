Burning For Thee
"Make me Thy fuel, Flame of God" - Amy Carmichael

Words and Music by Katie Garraway
Arranged by Katie Garraway

Lord, You know I don't have much to offer,
but You'll use all that I give.

I pray You'll make me more like Thee, 
serving You each day I live.

Father, hear this simple plea, purge all my faults, take all my pride.
Take my life, O Lord, I give it now,  hear my earnest cry.

Take my life, Lord, let it be consecrated all for Thee.
Take my life, Lord, let it be burning fuel for Thee.

Take my life, Lord, all I offer.
Let me burn for Thee.

Take my life, O Lord, I give it up now, take my works to be refined.
Please take my thoughts and actons, Lord, lead in Your perfect design.

Let me burn for You each day, help me to never go astray.
Take my life, O Lord, I give it now.

Only this I pray.

Take my life, Lord, let it be consecrated all for Thee.
Take my life, Lord, let it be burning fuel for Thee.

Take my life, Lord, all I offer.

Let me burn for Thee.

Take my life, Lord, all I offer.

Let me burn for Thee.

Burning for Thee!
