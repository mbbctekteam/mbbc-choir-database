LORD, BUILD YOUR CHURCH
Words and Music by: Chris Anderson

Verse 1
You promised, Lord, that You would work

To build a strong and vibrant church

A church that stands by grace alone

On Christ, our Rock and Cornerstone;

On Christ, our Rock and Cornerstone.

Verse 2
You called us, Lord, to join Your work:

To raise a pure and holy church

A temple made of living stones

United as Your Spirit’s home;

United as Your Spirit’s home.

Chorus
And so we pray: Lord, build Your church!

Deploy Your saints across the earth;

Destroy hell’s feeble, falling gates;

And glory in Your church’s praise;

And glory in Your church’s praise!

Verse 3
We thank You, Lord, that You have worked

To found a gospel-preaching church

And yet, our task remains undone;

Lord, build Your church until You come;

Lord, build Your church until You come!

Chorus
And so we pray: Lord, build Your church!

Deploy Your saints across the earth;

Destroy hell’s feeble, falling gates;

And glory in Your church’s praise;

And glory in Your church’s praise!

end
And glory in Your church’s praise;

And glory in Your church’s praise!
