SECURED BY SOV'REIGN LOVE
Words and Music by The Wilds

Chorus
So let Your grace surround me still,
And like a fortress prove,

To guard my soul, to guide my will,
Secured by sov'reign love,

Secured by sov'reign love.

Verse 1
Lord, all I am You know and see:

In vain my soul would try
To shun Your presence, or to flee

The notice of Your eye.
Your all-surrounding sight surveys

My rising and my rest,
My public deeds, my private ways,

The secrets unconfessed 

Chorus
So let Your grace surround me still,
And like a fortress prove,

To guard my soul, to guide my will,
Secured by sov'reign love,

Secured by sov'reign love.

Verse 2
My thoughts lie open to You, Lord,
Before they're formed within;

And as my lips pronounce each word,
You know the sense I mean.

O woundrous knowledge deep and high;
Where can a creature hide?

Within Your circling arms I lie,
Secure on ev'ry side.

Chorus
So let Your grace surround me still,
And like a fortress prove,

To guard my soul, to guide my will,
Secured by sov'reign love,

Secured by sov'reign love.
