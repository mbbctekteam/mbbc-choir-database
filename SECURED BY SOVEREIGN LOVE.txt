SECURED BY SOVEREIGN LOVE
(Text by Isaac Watts [alt.]; Tune by Faye López)

Lord, all I am You know and see:
In vain my soul would try
To shun Your presence, or to flee
The notice of Your eye.
Your all-surrounding sight surveys
My rising and my rest,
My public deeds, my private ways,
The secrets unconfessed.

Refrain:
So let Your grace surround me still,
And like a fortress prove,
To guard my soul, to guide my will,
Secured by sovereign love,
Secured by sovereign love.

My thoughts lie open to You, Lord,
Before they’re formed within;
And as my lips pronounce each word,
You know the sense I mean.
O wondrous knowledge! deep and high;
Where can a creature hide?
Within your circling arms I lie,
Secure on every side.
