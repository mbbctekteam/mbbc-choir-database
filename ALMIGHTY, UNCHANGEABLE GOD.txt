Verse 1
Who spread out the clouds before Him?
Who fashioned the earth with His hands?

Who created the starry host,
And formed the earth at His command?

Who scatters lightning before Him,
Commands the rain and snow to fall?

Who makes the nations tremble?
Who is Lord over all?

Chorus
He is Almighty, Unchangeable God,
King of kings,

Lord of lords,
Robed in majesty.

He rules and reigns,
For all eternity,

Almighty, Unchangeable God.

verse 2
He is like the light at sunrise,
Like the brightness after the rain.

Robed in splendor,
He's seated on His heavenly throne above.

His glory fills the heavens;
He is exalted over all.

Yet this God of Heaven loves me
With an everlasting love.

Chorus
He is Almighty, Unchangeable God,
King of kings,

Lord of lords,
Robed in majesty.

He rules and reigns,
For all eternity,

Almighty, Unchangeable God
