The Object of Your Love
Words and Music by: Andy Gleiser and Greg Habegger 

Verse 1
Apart from God, a slave to sin,
My guilt too much to bear.

My heart has found no hope within,
And peace gives way to care.

Yet now I see Your broken form
Upon dark Calvary.

It was my fault that You were torn;
You proved Your love fore me.

Chorus
Now I am yours and You are mine,
Oh precious thought to me!

The priceless gift of love divine
Provides security.

The life I owe such mercy
Could never be enough.

But thank you, Lord, for making me
The object of Your love.

Verse 2
With contrite heart I bow in shame
Before my God above.

Without regard for His great name,
I've sinned against His love.

Yet now my Savior's words I hear
Within this holy place,

"My friend, there is no need to fear,
You're at the Throne of Grace."

Chorus
Now I am yours and You are mine,
Oh precious thought to me!

The priceless gift of love divine
Provides security.

The life I owe such mercy
Could never be enough.

But thank you, Lord, for making me
The object of Your love.

Verse 3
And when I feel my heart would break
For grief within my soul,

Help me to know there's no mistake;
My God is in control.

Yet now I feel eternal arms
Supporting me inside.

You are a shade from every harm,
You'll never leave my side.

Chorus
Now I am yours and You are mine,
Oh precious thought to me!

The priceless gift of love divine
Provides security.

The life I owe such mercy
Could never be enough.

But thank you, Lord, for making me
The object of Your love.

But thank you, Lord, for making me
The object of Your love.
