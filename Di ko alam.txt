The God who spoke the world into existence,
And holds it in its place with His strong hand

Can meet my need without the least assistance - 
No miracle too great could I demand.

And as I come in prayer unto the King of Kings,
And humbly kneel before His holy throne,

I know that my petition I can boldly bring,
And that He delights to give unto His own.
 
Chorus
But if not, will I choose to love Him anyways?
But if not, will He still be worthy of my praise?

His great glory I'll proclaim
If He delivers from the flame,

But will I serve Him just the same
If not?
 
I say, "O Lord, I trust in You with all my heart".
And I pray, "O Father, let Thy will be done."

But what if His will is not to grant my heart's desire
In order to bring glory to His Son?

Will I still delight to do my Savior's bidding
When on my behalf He does not intervene?

I know that I will praise Him if He answers,
And when His hand of blessing can be seen.
 
Chorus
But if not, will I choose to love Him anyways?
But if not, will He still be worthy of my praise?

His great glory I'll proclaim
If He delivers from the flame,

But will I serve Him just the same
If not?
 
I know His grace will always be sufficient.
I know His strength my weakness will perfect.

I'll trust when it's beyond my comprehension
That my needs He will supply, and my paths He will direct,
 
But if not, I will choose to love Him anyways.
But if not, He will still be worthy of my praise.

His great glory I'll proclaim
If He delivers from the flame,

But I will serve Him just the same
If not.

His great glory I'll proclaim 
If He delivers from the flame,

But I will serve Him just ghe same
If not.
