A WORLD WE NEVER TOUCH
Words and Music by Mark Carouthers
Arranged by The John Marshalls Family

He walked along the shores of Galilee.
From clay He formed the healing balm,
That caused the blind to see.

When stones of wrath lay heavy in their hands,
He knelt to write His mercy in the sand.

Jesus came to set the captives free,
Showed us by the way He lived
The way we need to be.

Our love is more than words could ever say,
We must touch them with compassion,
To help them find their way.

How can we reach a world we never touch.
How can we show them Christ,
If we never show them love?

Just to say we care will never be enough.
How can we reach a world we never touch?

Could we be so busy being saved?
Trying to impress a world that's long since lost its way?

We pride ourselves in being set apart,
Yet we don't take time to touch a broken heart.

Even if we found the time to care,
Would we take the risk involved in always being there?

O we hold the very thing they need so much,
Sometimes the Word of God can pass
Thro' just a simple touch.

How can we reach a world we never touch.
How can we show them Christ,
If we never show them love?

Just to say we care will never be enough.
How can we reach a world we never touch?

We hide behind these walls,
And the security of friends,
While beyond the stained glass windows
The world is lost in sin.

How can we reach a world we never touch.
How can we show them Christ,
If we never show them love?

Just to say we care will never be enough.
How can we reach a world we never touch?

How can we reach a world we never touch?
