Wings as Eagles

verse 1
When the race still lies before me,
and the wind is blowing strong,

when the witnesses surround me,
and my strength is almost gone;

when the valley plunges deeper,
and life shatters all my dreams,

then I life my voice to Jesus,
and He gives my spirit wings.

chorus
God gives wings,
God gives wings as eagles;

God gives wings to fly and strength to rise above.

God gives wings,
God gives wings as eagles,

when my feet begin to stumble,
and my dreams begin to crumble,

I mount up on eagles wings.

verse 2
Let us run the race with patience,
let us lay each weight aside,

Looking only unto Jesus;
He will be our faithful guide.

He has run the race before us;
He has won the victorâ€™s crown.

And He calls to every Christian.
Follow me to higher ground.

chorus
God gives wings,
God gives wings as eagles;

God gives wings to fly and strength to rise above.

God gives wings,
God gives wings as eagles,

when my feet begin to stumble,
and my dreams begin to crumble,

I mount up on eagles wings.

I mount up on eagles wings.
