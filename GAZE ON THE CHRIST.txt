GAZE ON THE CHRIST
Words by Chris Anderson
Music by Greg Habegger

Chorus
Gaze on the Christ, our sacrifice
On altar made of wood.

Exalt the Lamb, the worthy Lamb,
Who bought us with His blood.

(SOLO)
Behold the Lamb, the spotless Lamb,
Who takes away our sin;

The debt we faced was not erased,
But paid in full by Him.

Verse 2
Behold the Lamb, the bleeding Lamb,
Who takes away the veil;

His body torn, His soul forlorn,
Christ cut to God a trail.

Chorus
Gaze on the Christ, our sacrifice
On altar made of wood.

Exalt the Lamb, the worthy Lamb,
Who bought us with His blood.

Verse 3
Behold the Lamb, the dying Lamb,
Who takes away just wrath;

God saw the blood of His beloved
And over us has passed.

Verse 4
Behold the Lamb, the risen Lamb,
Who takes away deathâ€™s sting;

All knees shall bend, all praise ascend
To Christ, the living King.

Chorus
Gaze on the Christ, our sacrifice
On altar made of wood.

Exalt the Lamb, the worthy Lamb,
Who bought us with His blood.

Exalt the Lamb, the worthy Lamb,

Who bought us with His blood.
