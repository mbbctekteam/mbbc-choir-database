SEE THE CHRIST
Words and Music by Paul Keew and Brian Pinner

Verse 1
See the Christ, the Son divine,
One with God before all time,

Lay aside His robe of light,
Clutching not His equal right.

See Him as a servant born,
Taking on our human form.

Make His humble mind your own;
Serve your brothers here below.

Verse 2
See the Christ, the Son of Man,
In obedience to God’s plan,

Take for us a sinner’s death,
Gasping out His final breath.

See Him on the cross of blood,
Proving there His love for God.

Trust the Father with your life;
He will turn all wrongs to right.

Verse 3
See the Christ, the Son, alive,
In His radiant place above,

Now exalted, raised on high,
Reigning from the Father’s side.

See Him take the greatest name:
Lord of All, by God proclaimed.

Hail Him King, and bow the knee
For the Father’s glory.

Hail Him King, and bow the knee
For the Father’s glory.
