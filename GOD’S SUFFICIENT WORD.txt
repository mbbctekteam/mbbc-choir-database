Verse 1
Believe in God’s inerrant Word,
Inspired and therefore pure.

Continue in the things you’ve learned,
For sacred Truth is sure.

Rejoice in God’s delightful Word
That satisfies the soul

Far sweeter than the honeycomb
And more desired than gold!

Submit to God’s transforming Word
Which makes the foolish wise.

The living, piercing, healing Sword
Yields righteousness through Christ.

Mature through God’s equipping Word
Until you’re fully grown.

Prepared to serve your gracious Lord,
Now work to make Him known.

Rejoice in God’s delightful Word
That satisfies the soul

And more desired than gold!

Depend on God’s sufficient Word
Which cannot be improved.

In light of judgment and reward,
Proclaim his changeless Truth.

Rejoice in God’s delightful Word
That satisfies the soul

Far sweeter than the honeycomb
And more desired than gold!

end
Rejoice in God’s delightful Word
That satisfies the soul

Far sweeter than the honeycomb
And more desired than gold!
