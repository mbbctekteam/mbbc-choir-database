BOW THE KNEE
WORD AND MUSIC BY RON HAMILTON AND CHERYL REID
MBBC CHOIR 

What a privilege to come into God's presence
Just to linger with the One who set me free.

As I lift my eyes and see His awesome glory.
I remember who He is and bow the knee.

Bow the knee (Bow the knee)
Bow the knee (Bow the knee)

He is King of all the ages
Bow the knee

God alone (God alone)
on His throne (on His throne)

See Him high and lifted up
and bow the knee.

Kneel before Him
All adore Him

As you live to love Him more
Bow the knee.

In His hands He holds
the power of creation.

With His voice He spoke,
and all things came to be.

Yet He hears each simple prayer
I bring before Him

When I humbly seek His face
and bow the knee.

Bow the knee (Bow the knee)
Bow the knee (Bow the knee)

He is King of all the ages
Bow the knee

God alone (God alone)
on His throne (on His throne)

See Him high and lifted up
and bow the knee.

Kneel before Him
All adore Him

As you live to love Him more
Bow the knee.

Kneel before Him
All adore Him

As you live to love Him more

Bow the knee.
