THE VALUE OF ONE

Verse 1 
Could it be that up in heaven
God is sitting on His throne

Anticipating another sinner
Will soon become His own.

Years of wasted living
And years of toil and strife

Are just about to be over
As He receives the gift of life

Chorus
Go sound the horn
Strike up the choir

A sinner is saved
Saved from the fire

No more in darkness
He's received my Son

All heaven's rejoicing
That's the value of one

Verse 2
The Holy spirit has been working
To soften up their hearts

All He needs is a willing servant
Who will simply do his part

Can you imagine up in heaven
The joy that will be that day

As a sinner bows his head to pray
Can't you hear the Father say

Chorus
Go sound the horn
Strike up the choir

A sinner is saved
Saved from the fire

No more in darkness
He's received my Son

All heaven's rejoicing
That's the value of one

Bridge
Start construction on His mansion
there on hallelujah street

He doesn't know yet that is waiting
As the Savior he will meet

Chorus
Go sound the horn
Strike up the choir

A sinner is saved
Saved from the fire

No more in darkness
He's received my Son

All heaven's rejoicing
That's the value of one

All heaven's rejoicing

THAT'S THE VALUE OF ONE
