DRAW NEAR THROUGH CHRIST
Words by: Chris Anderson
Music by James Koerts

Verse 1
In Eden’s bliss we walked with God
Unhindered by the curse.

Yet we rebelled and were expelled
Estranged; alone; perverse.

Two mighty cherubs barred the path
To Eden’s holy place;

No more could men, now stained by sin,
Behold our Maker’s face.

Verse 2
Beneath the Law we sought the Lord
Through sacrifice and priest.

One time each year one man, in fear,
Sought God with blood of beast.

Still mighty cherubs blocked the way
So sinners could not pass

In curtain sewn, on golden throne,
They stopped the rebel fast.

Verse 3
Then Christ appeared to clear the way
To God for sinful man;

Fulfilled the Law without a flaw
Our Temple, Priest, and Lamb.

Astounded cherubs stepped aside;
Each hid his flaming sword.

With nail and thorn the Veil was torn;
Draw near through Christ the Lord!

Verse 4
In Jesus’ name we boldly come
Before the throne of grace.

With empty hand, in Christ we stand
To seek Almighty’s face

Till saints and cherubs join in awe
Around the Savior’s throne.

With one great voice we will rejoice:
“All praise to Christ alone!”

“All praise to Christ alone!”
