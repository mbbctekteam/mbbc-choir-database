HOLY, HOLY
Words and Music by Matt Herbster

Verse 1
In the throne room of heaven, high and exalted, sits the King on His throne

Seraphim flying, loudly they're crying unto the Lord God alone

Verse 2
To a hill called Mount Calv'ry, love took our Savior so all men could be free

Satan defeating wounded and bleeding our spotless Lamb on the tree

Chorus
He is holy, holy, the earth is full of His glory

Holy, holy is the Lord God of hosts

Verse 3
Here am I, send and use me, fit me for service, purge my spirit anew

Search me and try me, cleanse, purify me so I can be more like You!

Chorus
He is holy, holy, the earth is full of His glory

Holy, holy is the Lord God of hosts

He is holy, holy,

He is the Lord God of hosts
