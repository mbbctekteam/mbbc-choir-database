I SING THE MIGHTY POWER OF GOD
(From Gesangbuch der Herzogl)
Words and Music by: Isaac Watts

Verse 1
I sing the mighty pow’r of God
That made the mountains rise

That spread the flowing seas abroad
And built the lofty skies.

I sing the wisdom that ordained
The sun to rule the day;

The moon shines full at His command
And all the stars obey.

Verse 2
I sing the goodness of the Lord
Who filled the earth with food,

Who formed the creatures through the Word
And then pronounced them good.

Lord, how Thy wonders are displayed,
Where’er I turn my eye,

If I survey the ground I tread,
Or gaze upon the sky.

Verse 3
There’s not a plant or flow’r below,
But makes Thy glories known,

And clouds arise, and tempests blow,
By order from Thy throne;

While all that borrows life from Thee
Is ever in Thy care;

And everywhere that we can be,
Thou, God, art present there.

Thou, God art present there
