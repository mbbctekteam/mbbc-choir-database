Peace in the Midst of My Storm
Words and Music by Lori Canaday
MMBC Choir

When my way seems so dim and unclear,
Jesus I'm glad I know You are near.

Weary and worn from this life I live. 
I long for the peace that You give.

Peace in the midst of my storm. 
Peace in the midst of my storm.

Draw me close to Thyself, O Lord,
and give me peace in the midst of my storm. 

Jesus, through You I've the power to stand.
You gave the promise that You'd hold my hand.

Trusting Your Word, to You I will cling. 
Praise for the peace that You bring.

Peace in the midst of my storm. 
Peace in the midst of my storm.

Draw me close to Thyself, O Lord,
and give me peace in the midst of my storm. 

Peace in the midst of my storm. 
Peace in the midst of my storm.

Draw me close to Thyself, O Lord,
and give me peace in the midst of my storm
