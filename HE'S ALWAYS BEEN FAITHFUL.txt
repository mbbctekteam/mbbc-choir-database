HE'S ALWAYS BEEN FAITHFUL
Bro. OJ

Verse 1
Morning by morning I wake up to find
The power and comfort of God's hand in mine

Season by season I watch Him, amazed
In awe of the mystery of His perfect ways

Chorus
All I have need of, His hand will provide

He's always been faithful to me.

Verse 2
I can't remember a trial or a pain
He did not recycle to bring me gain

I can't remember one single regret
In serving God only, and trusting His hand

Chorus
All I have need of, His hand will provide
He's always been faithful to me.

Verse 3
This is my anthem, this is my song
The theme of the stories I've heard for so long

God has been faithful, He will be again
His loving compassion, it knows no end

Chorus
Al| I have need of, His hand will provide
He's always been faithful,

He's always been faithful

HE'S ALWAYS BEEN FAITHFUL TO ME
