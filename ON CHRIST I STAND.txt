ON CHRIST I STAND
Words by Edward Mote and Music by Benjamin Harlan

Verse 1
My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus' blood and righteousness

I dare not trust the sweetest frame
But wholly lean on Jesus' name

Chorus
On Christ the solid Rock I stand
All other ground is sinking sand

A higher plane than I have found
On Christ the solid Rock I stand!

Verse 2
When darkness seems to hide His face
I rest on His unchanging grace

In evâ€™ry high and stormy gale
My anchor holds within the veil

Chorus
On Christ the solid Rock I stand
All other ground is sinking sand

A higher plane than I have found
On Christ the solid Rock I stand!

Verse 3
When He shall come with trumpet sound
O may I then in Him be found

Dressed in His righteousness alone
Faultless to stand before the throne

Chorus
On Christ the solid Rock I stand
All other ground is sinking sand

A higher plane than I have found
On Christ the solid Rock I stand!

Chorus
On Christ the solid Rock I stand
All other ground is sinking sand

A higher plane than I have found
On Christ the solid Rock I stand!

On Christ the solid Rock I stand!
